3/8/23, 5:06 PM - Elizabeth: ok?
3/8/23, 5:07 PM - Joshua Ahs: What is trans
3/8/23, 5:08 PM - Someone: Vivian Jenna wilson
3/8/23, 5:08 PM - Someone: She's a girl
3/8/23, 5:09 PM - Joshua Ahs: I don't understand what the word trans is
3/8/23, 5:10 PM - Someone: ... ...
3/8/23, 5:11 PM - Joshua Ahs: Ok time to hit the internet
3/8/23, 5:13 PM - Joshua Ahs: Wait I checked and trans is a prefix which means across or beyond
3/8/23, 5:13 PM - Elizabeth: lmao
3/8/23, 5:13 PM - Joshua Ahs: Ok
3/8/23, 5:13 PM - Joshua Ahs: But that doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence
3/8/23, 5:14 PM - Elizabeth: 🫢🤦‍♀️💀💀
3/8/23, 5:14 PM - Elizabeth: just
3/8/23, 5:15 PM - Elizabeth: pretend no one ever said that
3/8/23, 5:15 PM - Joshua Ahs: Second definition is a prefix for through
3/8/23, 5:15 PM - Joshua Ahs: Doesn't make sense
3/8/23, 5:16 PM - Joshua Ahs: Wait those are all prefixes
3/8/23, 5:16 PM - Joshua Ahs: This one isn't
3/8/23, 5:16 PM - Joshua Ahs: It is an adjective
3/8/23, 5:18 PM - Joshua Ahs: The first adjetive definition is denoting or relating to a molecular structure in which two particular atoms or groups lie on opposite sides of a given plane in the molecule, in particular denoting an isomer in which substituents at opposite ends of a carbon–carbon double bond are also on opposite sides of the bond: Compare with cis.
3/8/23, 5:18 PM - Joshua Ahs: Well people aren't carbon atoms
3/8/23, 5:18 PM - Joshua Ahs: So I will check the second adjective definition.
3/8/23, 5:19 PM - Joshua Ahs: The second one is denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex:
3/8/23, 5:19 PM - Joshua Ahs: i think this is the correct definition
3/8/23, 5:20 PM - Joshua Ahs: Because it is talking about people, not molecules.
3/8/23, 5:21 PM - Joshua Ahs: but how is it possible for someone to change their gender
3/8/23, 5:21 PM - Ryner Ahs: <Media omitted>

3/9/23, 10:22 PM - Someone: https://chat.whatsapp.com/ByWKbUy5WDq4QyxnKLHuid
3/9/23, 10:26 PM - En Yu Ahs: Help
3/9/23, 10:26 PM - AHS Christopher: Btw here's de explanation:
Each pair of turns, there are 3 scenarios: 1. Alice scores 2 times in a row and wins, with a probability of (2/3)²=4/9.
2. Bob scores once and wins, prob.=1/3
3. Alice scores first, then Bob. Prob=2/9, but as this leads to the same set of scenarios as before, this is ignored.
So prob Alice wins in a pair:prob Bob wins  in a pair=4/9:3/9=4/3
Prob Alice wins =4/(4+3)=4/7
3/9/23, 10:27 PM - AHS Christopher: None of u chose the correct ans I'm disappointed

3/10/23, 10:11 PM - Elvin Ahs: *[AHS 2023 Family Fiesta - Invitation to the Family Fiesta Walk]*

Dear Parent,

With the AHS Family Fiesta just around the corner, here's what you can expect!

*7:45am: Family Fiesta Walk*
Bring your family for the AHS 早操 and join the students for a walk around the neighbourhood! 🚶🏻‍♂️🚶🏻‍♀️🚶🏻

You can choose to join the PSG representative to know other parents or walk with your teen!

Look for our Chairperson Mr John Ng or Vice-Chairperson Mr Teo Hock Soon at the field near Gate 2. (Please refer to the attached picture file for where to find them.)

9am: Family Fiesta Carnival
What is Family Fiesta without the carnival?! 🤩

There will be food, games at the carnival. BUT... most importantly, there will be Bubble Tea sold at Milky Way - a booth by the PSG! 😍

Look out for the snaking queues and you will know where we are! Come say hi to our CAs and PAs! You may also bump into a familiar face while queuing for our Bubble Tea from LiHo!

All transactions are by coupons only! You can purchase coupons from counters located all around. Each set of coupons is worth $5.00.

12pm: Lucky Draw at School Hall
Used up your coupons? Don't throw the stub away!

Pass them to your AHS teens for a chance to win a prize from the lucky draw!

(Lucky draw winners must be AHS teens only.)

With so much going on at the AHS Family Fiesta, we are sure you will have a great time with your family!

See you there!

P.s.: School grounds will not permit parking during the carnival. Please park your vehicles at the public carparks located outside the school.

Blessings,
Ivy Goh-Soh (Mrs)
AHS PSG

3/17/23, 9:50 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: So you find a common factor inclusive of letters
3/17/23, 9:50 PM - Joshua Ahs: Actually you also need to do war crimes in Ukraine
3/17/23, 9:50 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Then you divide both terms with that common factor
3/17/23, 9:50 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Then you take the divided terms and put a bracket around them
3/17/23, 9:51 PM - Joshua Ahs: Those gay letters for this question even have common factors
3/17/23, 9:51 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Then out the common factor in front of the brackets

3/29/23, 10:39 PM - Joshua Ahs: Proof about Jasson x Emma-Joy
3/29/23, 10:41 PM - Joshua Ahs: This message was deleted
3/29/23, 10:41 PM - Joshua Ahs: Updated it
3/29/23, 10:41 PM - Ethan Ahs: 🫤
3/29/23, 10:46 PM - Joshua Ahs: Version 1.2.0
Jasson x Emma-Joy proof
In electrical engineering, j is used as the imaginary number, as i is already the current. The names Jasson and Emma-Joy are represented by their initials, becoming j x ej, or j(ej), which is j²(e), which is -1(e), as an imaginary number squared is the magnitude squared but you make it negative. When we expand the expression, it is -e, which is actually -2.72 (to 3 s.f.), as e is actually Euler's number,  which is a constant which is the base of natural logarithms. It is the limit of ⁿ as n approaches infinity. This is a real number, as it is not imaginary, and it is a constant, not a variable, meaning it is always going to be real and never imaginary. Therefore, Jasson x Emma-Joy is real and not imaginary.

You are only at the end. And the road is very long , but no, this is what I didn't mean. If this is what it must take for you to deez nutz, then so be it. But none of you are near the level of your mother.
Focus on your nuts, no matter how long. Make its mom your mom, and an enemy can be turned into deez nutz."
I have your mother now. Deez nutz has made me infinite! The Nutz Ninja is mine! The Overlord to the mother in the Digiverse.

4/20/23, 8:54 PM - Joshua Ahs: Arise ye workers from your slumbers
Arise ye prisoners of want
For reason in revolt now thunders
And at last ends the age of cant.
Away with all your superstitions
Servile masses arise, arise
We’ll change henceforth the old tradition
And spurn the dust to win the prize.

Refrain:
So comrades, come rally
And the last fight let us face
The Internationale unites the human race.

No more deluded by reaction
On tyrants only we’ll make war
The soldiers too will take strike action
They’ll break ranks and fight no more
And if those cannibals keep trying
To sacrifice us to their pride
They soon shall hear the bullets flying
We’ll shoot the generals on our own side.

No saviour from on high delivers
No faith have we in prince or peer
Our own right hand the chains must shiver
Chains of hatred, greed and fear
E’er the thieves will out with their booty
And give to all a happier lot.
Each at the forge must do their duty
And we’ll strike while the iron is hot.

5/4/23, 4:30 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Indeed
5/4/23, 4:30 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I faces time itself
5/4/23, 4:31 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Einstien(I think) was the first to ask *what is time? "
5/4/23, 4:31 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: He claims that if movement is relative, how would we know if something is moving if there's nothing to compare it to?
5/4/23, 4:31 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Then he concluded with "in short, what is time?"
5/4/23, 4:39 PM - Jasson Ahs: It is one of many illusions made by people in the real world trying to make us think the a "reality" we live in is real
5/4/23, 4:40 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: That's true to a certain extent
5/4/23, 4:42 PM - Someone: Well
5/4/23, 4:42 PM - Someone: Technically time ain't real
5/4/23, 4:42 PM - Someone: Cuz u can change time
5/4/23, 4:42 PM - Someone: Which is what sg did
5/4/23, 4:43 PM - Jasson Ahs: Yeah time was just made up
5/4/23, 4:43 PM - Jasson Ahs: But the concept of time already existed
5/4/23, 4:44 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Not rlly
5/4/23, 4:44 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: The measurement
5/4/23, 4:45 PM - Jasson Ahs: THERE IS NO PROOF ANYTHING IS REAL
5/4/23, 4:46 PM - Joshua Ahs: Except for Jasson x Nathanial
5/4/23, 4:46 PM - Joshua Ahs: Which is proven to be real
5/4/23, 4:46 PM - Jasson Ahs: NO
5/4/23, 4:47 PM - Elizabeth: . . .
5/4/23, 4:47 PM - Jasson Ahs: Nathaniel is with Gloria

5/4/23, 4:48 PM - Joshua Ahs: iloveAHS1234
5/4/23, 4:48 PM - Jasson Ahs: ALSO THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT REALITY IS REAL SO NOTHING CAN BE PROVEN
5/4/23, 4:49 PM - Joshua Ahs: Which means that 1+1 could equal 69
5/4/23, 4:49 PM - Jasson Ahs: WHICH MEANS MATH COULD ALL JUST BE A LIE
5/4/23, 4:50 PM - Joshua Ahs: <Media omitted>
5/4/23, 4:51 PM - Jasson Ahs: IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT EVEN IF EVERYTHING IN THIS REALITY IS REAL MATH IS STILL MADE UP
5/4/23, 4:51 PM - Jasson Ahs: SAME WITH SCIENCE
5/4/23, 4:52 PM - Jasson Ahs: AND LANGUAGES
5/4/23, 4:52 PM - Joshua Ahs: AND HUMANITIES
5/4/23, 4:52 PM - Jasson Ahs: ONLY HISTORY
5/4/23, 4:52 PM - Joshua Ahs: Why
5/4/23, 4:53 PM - Joshua Ahs: You hate Ms Huang isit
5/4/23, 4:53 PM - Jasson Ahs: cuz history is about the past
5/4/23, 4:54 PM - Jasson Ahs: It happened in this reality
5/4/23, 4:54 PM - Joshua Ahs: How about literature
5/4/23, 4:54 PM - Joshua Ahs: Literature and Geography too
5/4/23, 4:54 PM - Jasson Ahs: Literature is from a language and language is made up by a random person
5/4/23, 4:55 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Actually lly
5/4/23, 4:55 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: This(if I'm not wrong) is a realqn in philosophy
5/4/23, 4:55 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Some might say
5/4/23, 4:56 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: "just look around you"
5/4/23, 4:56 PM - Joshua Ahs: <Media omitted>
5/4/23, 4:56 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: And? Eyes can deceive
5/4/23, 4:56 PM - Jasson Ahs: Geography is partially true if everything is actually what it is but there are many factors of geo that is proven by science and science isn't proven by anything
5/4/23, 4:56 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: In fact all sensory organs are untrusable of sorts
5/4/23, 4:56 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Hence
5/4/23, 4:56 PM - Joshua Ahs: It's proven by experiments
5/4/23, 4:56 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: We don't actually know if anyt it real
5/4/23, 4:57 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: But there's some qns within this qn
5/4/23, 4:57 PM - Joshua Ahs: Which means tandas might not be real
5/4/23, 4:57 PM - Joshua Ahs: 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
5/4/23, 4:57 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: If this is true, then how do we "know" Abt it?
5/4/23, 4:57 PM - Jasson Ahs: And experiments are proven by science
5/4/23, 4:57 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: How can other ppl tell us so?
5/4/23, 4:57 PM - Jasson Ahs: So what if they are both wrong
5/4/23, 4:58 PM - Jasson Ahs: I feel like we're starting a religion
5/4/23, 4:58 PM - Joshua Ahs: We should call it tandasm
5/4/23, 4:59 PM - Joshua Ahs: Or tandasisim
5/4/23, 4:59 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Started alr actually it's called conspiracy theorism
5/4/23, 4:59 PM - Joshua Ahs: No it's called tandasism
5/4/23, 4:59 PM - Jasson Ahs: No the world is a conspiracy
5/4/23, 5:00 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Can't believe I go to sleep thinking Abt these qns

5/4/23, 5:00 PM - Jasson Ahs: There is nothing proving that what we believe in is real so reality can be whatever it is
5/4/23, 5:00 PM - Jasson Ahs: Hey
5/4/23, 5:00 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Dare I say logic of a too far extent doesn't go hand in hand with emotions
5/4/23, 5:00 PM - Joshua Ahs: This isn't even real

5/6/23, 5:12 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Don't use bombastic and unnecessary words
5/6/23, 5:12 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Grammarly
5/6/23, 5:12 PM - Jasson Ahs: Okay
5/6/23, 5:13 PM - Jasson Ahs: So since a fucking army of K-pop fans have invaded the answers, here’s an answer from my perspective:

+ Manufactured, generic music

+ Cringy fandom

+ The truckload of people calling you racist for not liking K-pop -> so am I supposed to call you racist for not liking Indian classical music?

+ Being called homophobic -> Dislike of k-pop does not indicate homophobia.

So let’s hypothesize with some amount of rationale here. By this logic, not liking reggae makes you racist. By this logic, not liking BTS makes you a homophobe.

The music genuinely sounds like trash to anyone who’s studied music seriously, there is no sense of musical depth, there is absolute zero in terms of what makes it a great song.

Then again you have the marketing genius of the managers who manage to create such a dedicated fandom, to the point that if you don’t like a certain genre you are a racist, insensitive piece of shit who deserves to die.

Have you ever heard of Robert Johnson? He was an actual musician who got poisoned. He suffered his entire life because of actual racism, yet he is practically one of the founders of blues and rock (along with Muddy Waters).

But the massive army of KPop stans last time I checked haven’t spent years of their life studying music in multiple forms, so might as well accept it.

5/12/23, 6:17 PM - Joshua Ahs: [Куплет 1]
Возомнила ты себе, что можешь всех учить
Чем питаться, одеваться, да вообще как жить
Длинный нос суёшь ты свой ну аж за материк
Только жить по-твоему не будет наш мужик!

[Куплет 2]
Мы ребята добрые и в гости всех зовём
Ну а тем, кто к нам с мечом-покажем свой приём!
Воевать не любим мы, но правду что ж скрывать:
За Россию-Матушку готовы мы порвать!

[Припев]
Эх, Америка! Островок, два берега!
Что же вам спокойно не живётся у себя?
С вашей демократией оставайтесь сами-ка
И вообще, как говорят - начните-ка с себя!

[Куплет 3]
Знаю, что тебе досадно, ведь за двадцать лет
Разбазарила по миру свой авторитет
Там куда суёшься ты, совсем тебя не ждут
А где побывала ты, там мирно не живут

[Куплет 4]
Может быть пора свернуть нахальный твой проект
Время подошло признаться - веры к тебе нет!
Ты хотела бесконечно подкупать весь свет
Но, нам дороже совесть из Москвы тебе привет!

[Припев]
Эх, Америка! Островок, два берега!
Что же вам спокойно не живётся у себя?
С вашей демократией оставайтесь сами-ка
И вообще, как говорят - начните-ка с себя!

Эх, ребятушки! Чево наделали!
[Припев]
Эх, Америка! Островок, два берега!
Что же вам спокойно не живётся у себя?
С вашей демократией оставайтесь сами-ка
И вообще, как говорят - начните-ка с себя!
И вообще, как говорят - начните-ка с себя!

5/13/23, 2:32 PM - Joshua Ahs: It's like nfts or something probably
5/13/23, 2:32 PM - Jasson Ahs: No nfts are dead
5/13/23, 2:32 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Woa woa no foul language in the court of 1c
5/13/23, 2:32 PM - Joshua Ahs: Ya
5/13/23, 2:32 PM - +65 8838 9539: okay but like if u print pokemon cards does it feel the same as the pokemon cards u buy
5/13/23, 2:33 PM - Jasson Ahs: Wut how that foul
5/13/23, 2:33 PM - Joshua Ahs: But I think the kpop cards are a lot like nfts
5/13/23, 2:33 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Pokemon cards have no value to me
5/13/23, 2:33 PM - +65 8838 9539: oh
5/13/23, 2:33 PM - +65 8838 9539: uh
5/13/23, 2:33 PM - Jasson Ahs: No because you can't use them in tournaments
5/13/23, 2:33 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Ur poving her point
5/13/23, 2:33 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: And
5/13/23, 2:33 PM - Joshua Ahs: It has no value itself 
But everyone wants it
5/13/23, 2:33 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: You could replicate one
5/13/23, 2:33 PM - Joshua Ahs: Because it's the original copy or something
5/13/23, 2:33 PM - Joshua Ahs: I don't know
5/13/23, 2:34 PM - +65 8838 9539: its the same thing with money
5/13/23, 2:34 PM - Jasson Ahs: Oh, then people sell fake pokemon cards and people buy them knowing it's fake
5/13/23, 2:34 PM - +65 8838 9539: if u print money urself then there’s like no value
5/13/23, 2:34 PM - Jasson Ahs: No you use money to buy things
5/13/23, 2:34 PM - Jasson Ahs: The card is useless
5/13/23, 2:35 PM - Joshua Ahs: You can sell it for money
5/13/23, 2:35 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Bc two pieces of money cannot be 100% the same, but once you change something that is different in all bills, and avoid government, then it will have value
5/13/23, 2:35 PM - +65 8838 9539: i have no idea what ur saying 🔥
5/13/23, 2:35 PM - Joshua Ahs: But you'll go to jail
5/13/23, 2:35 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Ofc you don't
5/13/23, 2:35 PM - Jasson Ahs: No it's useless in the sense that it cannot be used unless given away
5/13/23, 2:36 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Money works in a sense of belief
5/13/23, 2:36 PM - Jasson Ahs: Money works but the economy
5/13/23, 2:36 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Money's value is because people think that it has value, despite it not actually having value
5/13/23, 2:36 PM - Joshua Ahs: Actually, due to inflation, if you print more money, the value of money would decrease
5/13/23, 2:37 PM - Jasson Ahs: It's the amount of money that gives it value
5/13/23, 2:37 PM - Joshua Ahs: Ya
5/13/23, 2:37 PM - Jasson Ahs: No it's not the amount of money but the measurements used
5/13/23, 2:38 PM - Joshua Ahs: Whatndo you mean
5/13/23, 2:38 PM - Joshua Ahs: The money we are using now is actually Fiat money, which is bad. We should return to the gold standard.
5/13/23, 2:38 PM - Jasson Ahs: I mean math
5/13/23, 2:39 PM - Joshua Ahs: What measurements are you talking about
5/13/23, 2:39 PM - Jasson Ahs: If cards have money that can be traded why have anything on the card
5/13/23, 2:42 PM - Joshua Ahs: Because people believe it has value
5/13/23, 2:43 PM - Joshua Ahs: Like money
5/13/23, 2:43 PM - Joshua Ahs: And the value of the card is determined by the amount of that item and the amount of people who want it, or supply and demNd
5/13/23, 2:44 PM - +65 8838 9539: its bc if there’s nothing on it then no one wants to buy it
5/13/23, 2:44 PM - Joshua Ahs: <Media omitted>
5/13/23, 2:44 PM - Joshua Ahs: Because no one believes it has value so they won't buy it
5/13/23, 2:45 PM - Joshua Ahs: Although I find that they don't have value
5/13/23, 2:46 PM - +65 8838 9539: <Media omitted>
5/13/23, 2:47 PM - Joshua Ahs: It's only because you and other simps believe the glass rabbit has value
5/13/23, 2:48 PM - +65 8838 9539: i honestly don’t know why it has more value but alot of ppl want it
5/13/23, 2:49 PM - Joshua Ahs: It has high demand
5/13/23, 2:49 PM - Joshua Ahs: And the supply is probably very low
5/13/23, 2:49 PM - Joshua Ahs: Probably they made very few
5/13/23, 2:49 PM - Joshua Ahs: <Media omitted>
5/13/23, 2:49 PM - Jasson Ahs: The difference between crypto currency and collector cards are that cards are a joke
5/13/23, 2:49 PM - Joshua Ahs: Therefore it's overpriced
5/13/23, 2:50 PM - Joshua Ahs: But they both are scams
5/13/23, 2:50 PM - +65 8838 9539: i dont think so I think they make equal amounts but it’s just that hes a popular member
5/13/23, 2:50 PM - Jasson Ahs: Yes, crypto is a scam but collector cards is a stupid scam
5/13/23, 2:51 PM - Joshua Ahs: So higher demand and same supply would mean the cost is higher
5/13/23, 2:51 PM - Joshua Ahs: They are both overhyped
5/13/23, 2:53 PM - +65 8838 9539: yes
5/13/23, 2:56 PM - Jasson Ahs: The reason other things that are worth a lot aren't scams is because they were originally products that could be used for useful stuff but eventually after a long time the amount of these products in a good condition decreased so they are worth more and hence are not scams
5/13/23, 2:56 PM - Joshua Ahs: Yeah
5/13/23, 2:56 PM - Joshua Ahs: Supply decreased but demand stayed the same
5/13/23, 4:14 PM - Someone: Hi

(b)	to reimburse any specified body for any costs or expenses incurred by it;

5/19/23, 8:50 PM - Joshua Ahs: @6588228412
5/19/23, 8:51 PM - Jasson Ahs: Just tell me when I'm getting the cookies
5/19/23, 8:51 PM - +65 8838 9539: its girl guides not brigade
5/19/23, 8:51 PM - Jasson Ahs: We know
5/19/23, 8:51 PM - En Yu Ahs: I donno they nvr say le
5/19/23, 8:51 PM - +65 8838 9539: anyways either by the end of this term or in august
5/19/23, 8:51 PM - Ban Lee Ahs: damn
5/19/23, 8:51 PM - Vera Ahs: um after sch holis we will update yall dont worry and like once it arrives we will give yall we wont like keep it so dont worry 🔥
5/19/23, 8:51 PM - Jasson Ahs: August???
5/19/23, 8:51 PM - Ban Lee Ahs: ya ja sown
5/19/23, 8:51 PM - Joshua Ahs: @6589078600 you wasted $45 on this
5/19/23, 8:52 PM - Ban Lee Ahs: ja sown why so rush
5/19/23, 8:52 PM - +65 8838 9539: idk man cher said by the end of the term but my senior say august
5/19/23, 8:53 PM - Jasson Ahs: I want to believe the cher
5/19/23, 8:53 PM - Jasson Ahs: The gap is 3 days - 3 months
5/19/23, 8:54 PM - Ban Lee Ahs: who tell you spend 45 dollars on cookies
5/19/23, 8:54 PM - Jasson Ahs: Me
5/19/23, 8:55 PM - Jasson Ahs: I wasted $11 on pizza of a flavor I didn't even want and the pizza was completely smushed
5/19/23, 8:55 PM - Ban Lee Ahs: ok
5/19/23, 8:56 PM - Jasson Ahs: I always spend a lot of money on the cookies every year
5/19/23, 8:56 PM - Joshua Ahs: Wu Le Tao
5/19/23, 8:57 PM - Jasson Ahs: And I donated $22.50 to charity
5/19/23, 8:57 PM - Jasson Ahs: So technically I only spent $22.50 on cookies
5/19/23, 8:58 PM - Joshua Ahs: But you still paid $45
5/19/23, 8:58 PM - Jasson Ahs: Yeah but charity doesn't count
5/19/23, 9:01 PM - Joshua Ahs: Which charity anyway
5/19/23, 9:05 PM - Jasson Ahs: Don't know
5/19/23, 9:05 PM - Jasson Ahs: Don't care

5/20/23, 4:30 PM - Joshua Ahs: They should all do that
5/20/23, 4:57 PM - Someone: <Media omitted>
5/20/23, 4:58 PM - Elizabeth: u hv to write statement bru
5/20/23, 4:59 PM - Someone: What kinda
5/20/23, 4:59 PM - Someone: Teach me
5/20/23, 4:59 PM - Elizabeth: like example u write 
Distance the ____ travels=20km/h
5/20/23, 5:00 PM - Elizabeth: that kinda thing
5/20/23, 5:00 PM - Someone: Ok
5/20/23, 5:00 PM - Elizabeth: idk the qn so
5/20/23, 5:03 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: They asked for GRADIENT if I'm not wrong
5/20/23, 5:03 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: You're writing his speed
5/20/23, 5:03 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Hence
5/20/23, 5:03 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: No ATQ
5/20/23, 5:04 PM - Someone: Uhhhh
5/20/23, 5:04 PM - Someone: THE GRADIENT IS SPEED
5/20/23, 5:04 PM - Jasson Ahs: You know I'm the average height for someone in the 18th century or a North Korean 14 year old
5/20/23, 5:04 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: In this case
5/20/23, 5:04 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: However
5/20/23, 5:04 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Gradient can be negative
5/20/23, 5:04 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Speed cannot be negative
5/20/23, 5:04 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Therefore
5/20/23, 5:04 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Gradient≠speed
5/20/23, 5:05 PM - Someone: I will prove it with physics
5/20/23, 5:05 PM - Someone: Jk
5/20/23, 5:05 PM - Someone: Just gostun
5/20/23, 5:05 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: What are u gonna walk backwards
5/20/23, 5:05 PM - Someone: How did uk
5/20/23, 5:05 PM - Jasson Ahs: That's distance
5/20/23, 5:06 PM - Someone: Ye
5/20/23, 5:06 PM - Someone: If dis is neg
5/20/23, 5:06 PM - Someone: Time is ps
5/20/23, 5:06 PM - Someone: Then speed wld be neg
5/20/23, 5:06 PM - Someone: Wait a min
5/20/23, 5:06 PM - Someone: I BROKE PHYSICS
5/20/23, 5:07 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Bro
5/20/23, 5:07 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Explain negative distance
5/20/23, 5:07 PM - Someone: Backwards cycling
5/20/23, 5:07 PM - Someone: Reverse gear
5/20/23, 5:07 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: You're moving a positive distance, just facing the other way
5/20/23, 5:08 PM - Someone: Technically no
5/20/23, 5:08 PM - Someone: Can we argue later
5/20/23, 5:08 PM - Someone: I need the ans
5/20/23, 5:09 PM - Someone: @yu
5/20/23, 5:09 PM - Someone: @6580245644
5/20/23, 5:09 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Un
5/20/23, 5:09 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Um
5/20/23, 5:09 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Wrong statement
5/20/23, 5:09 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Also negative gradients are negative
5/20/23, 5:10 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Have to write Abt gradient
5/20/23, 5:10 PM - Someone: JUST GIMME HOW TO WRITE THE STATEMENT
5/20/23, 5:10 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: You can just write gradient OA (for example)=dadada
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Someone: What dadada
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Like whatever lor
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Alden: What is the highest point of p u can get
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Ur answers r correct
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Someone: Hih
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: ?
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Someone: Huh
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Alden: P for the math thing
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Someone: 3
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Idk leh
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Alden: <Media omitted>
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: That's ur ans
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Someone: Presentation
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Alden: O
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Someone: 3
5/20/23, 5:11 PM - Alden: O
5/20/23, 5:12 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: L
5/20/23, 5:12 PM - Someone: You deleted this message
5/20/23, 5:12 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Bozo
5/20/23, 5:12 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Wait I thought c2
5/20/23, 5:12 PM - Someone: Shaddup
5/20/23, 5:12 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Wait no c1 is better ain't iti
5/20/23, 5:12 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Idk
5/20/23, 5:12 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Either way
5/20/23, 5:12 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Just do ur he and do what Mr teo says
5/20/23, 5:13 PM - Someone: <Media omitted>
5/20/23, 5:16 PM - Someone: Yu we8
5/20/23, 5:16 PM - Someone: Yu wei
5/20/23, 5:16 PM - Someone: Although what u said abt distance is correct
5/20/23, 5:16 PM - Someone: I have a theory
5/20/23, 5:16 PM - Someone: @6580245644
5/20/23, 5:17 PM - Someone: If u put two things in the universe space
5/20/23, 5:17 PM - Someone: <Media omitted>
5/20/23, 5:18 PM - Someone: The green one is the longest
5/20/23, 5:19 PM - Someone: And since the green can be infinity
5/20/23, 5:19 PM - Someone: And infinity can be converted to negative infinity
5/20/23, 5:19 PM - Someone: Technically the dist would be negative infinity
5/20/23, 5:21 PM - Someone: Tbh this doesn't sound right so um if anyone wanna counter attack pls do
5/20/23, 5:21 PM - Joshua Ahs: What is happening
5/20/23, 5:21 PM - Someone: I'm proving negative distance
5/20/23, 5:21 PM - Joshua Ahs: Also the thing is infinity isn't even a number
5/20/23, 5:21 PM - Someone: Ik
5/20/23, 5:22 PM - Joshua Ahs: It's an idea
5/20/23, 5:22 PM - Someone: It's more the any real number
5/20/23, 5:22 PM - Someone: Not only
5/20/23, 5:22 PM - Someone: It's a theory
5/20/23, 5:22 PM - Someone: And a theory on a theory is a theory
5/20/23, 5:23 PM - Someone: So my theory is
5/20/23, 5:23 PM - Someone: Negative infinity dist is possible
5/20/23, 5:23 PM - Someone: @6580245644
5/20/23, 5:23 PM - Someone: Can u prove me wrong pls
5/20/23, 5:23 PM - Someone: I need to refine on this
5/20/23, 5:27 PM - Someone: If it's only a idea then space-time relativity would also only be an idea
5/20/23, 5:28 PM - Joshua Ahs: They are both theroies
5/20/23, 5:28 PM - Someone: Exactly
5/20/23, 5:28 PM - Someone: So technically I can make a theory based on another one
5/20/23, 5:29 PM - Someone: I finally used my brain half(?)(more or less prolly less)(I randomly came up with it) pontential
5/20/23, 5:30 PM - Joshua Ahs: However, this is only theoretically possible
5/20/23, 5:30 PM - Someone: Exactly
5/20/23, 5:31 PM - Someone: So it's a theory
5/20/23, 5:31 PM - Someone: YESSSSSSSSS
5/20/23, 5:32 PM - Joshua Ahs: Anyway I'm going to make html code for my own hunger games simulator
5/20/23, 5:34 PM - Someone: Ok
5/20/23, 5:36 PM - Someone: I need to show this to Mr teo
5/20/23, 5:36 PM - Joshua Ahs: I approve of this argument
5/20/23, 5:36 PM - Someone: This is a research breakthrough
5/20/23, 5:36 PM - Joshua Ahs: Because I put negative distance as well
5/20/23, 5:36 PM - Someone: And Joshua approved
5/20/23, 5:36 PM - Someone: High five joshua
5/20/23, 5:36 PM - Someone: I didnt
5/20/23, 5:36 PM - Someone: But I think it's possible
5/20/23, 5:37 PM - Joshua Ahs: @6586965532 you did
5/20/23, 5:38 PM - Joshua Ahs: Actually that was speed
5/20/23, 5:38 PM - Joshua Ahs: actually I did put negative speed
5/20/23, 5:38 PM - Someone: No
5/20/23, 5:38 PM - Someone: Neg dist leads to neg speed
5/20/23, 5:39 PM - Someone: You deleted this message
5/20/23, 5:52 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Hold your horses
5/20/23, 5:52 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Shortest dist from what
5/20/23, 5:52 PM - Someone: Each other
5/20/23, 5:52 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Lemme read it hol on
5/20/23, 5:53 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Green is not infinity
5/20/23, 5:53 PM - Someone: Huh
5/20/23, 5:53 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: The observable universe is NOT infinite
5/20/23, 5:53 PM - Someone: I didn't say observable
5/20/23, 5:53 PM - Someone: Idiot
5/20/23, 5:53 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Hm
5/20/23, 5:53 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: That's moving on to theoretical liao
5/20/23, 5:54 PM - Someone: Why did u think I thought b4 phrasing that sentence
5/20/23, 5:54 PM - Someone: Exactly
5/20/23, 5:54 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: So this is an assumption that the universe is infinite
5/20/23, 5:54 PM - Someone: It's alr a theory
5/20/23, 5:54 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Wdym ∞ can be converted itno -∞
5/20/23, 5:54 PM - Someone: Else count the multiverse
5/20/23, 5:54 PM - Someone: Think abt it
5/20/23, 5:54 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Nvr heard of it but I'll take ur word
5/20/23, 5:54 PM - Someone: Wait
5/20/23, 5:54 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I'm not sure I follow
5/20/23, 5:54 PM - Someone: Lemme search
5/20/23, 5:55 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: No thx
5/20/23, 5:55 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Ill take ur word
5/20/23, 5:56 PM - Someone: Uhm
5/20/23, 5:56 PM - Someone: It might not be
5/20/23, 5:56 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Are u saying that ∞=-∞
5/20/23, 5:56 PM - Someone: But just count the multiverse then
5/20/23, 5:56 PM - Someone: This is the part where I confused myself
5/20/23, 5:56 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: So
5/20/23, 5:57 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Wym when u say ∞ can be converted into -∞
5/20/23, 5:57 PM - Someone: Wait
5/20/23, 5:58 PM - Someone: The reason I came up was
5/20/23, 5:58 PM - Someone: Due to infinity not stating must be positive or negative
5/20/23, 5:58 PM - Someone: They can be interchangeable
5/20/23, 5:58 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Youre saying that ∞=-∞
5/20/23, 5:58 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Which is it true?
5/20/23, 5:59 PM - Someone: Idk
5/20/23, 5:59 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: X=-x only if x=0
5/20/23, 5:59 PM - Someone: Prolly not
5/20/23, 5:59 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: If x is a real no idk if there are other solutions
5/20/23, 5:59 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: So
5/20/23, 5:59 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Let's define infinity shall we
5/20/23, 5:59 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: There are dif infinites
5/20/23, 6:00 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Smallest one id aleph null
5/20/23, 6:00 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Which is 1+2+3+4+5+6…
5/20/23, 6:00 PM - Joshua Ahs: This is actually -1/12
5/20/23, 6:01 PM - Someone: Alright
5/20/23, 6:01 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Er
5/20/23, 6:01 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Hm
5/20/23, 6:01 PM - Someone: Huh
5/20/23, 6:01 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Lemme see eq
5/20/23, 6:01 PM - Someone: Huh what is eq
5/20/23, 6:01 PM - Someone: Huh
5/20/23, 6:02 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Rq*
5/20/23, 6:02 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Watch value
5/20/23, 6:02 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Vsauce*
5/20/23, 6:02 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Also joshua
5/20/23, 6:02 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: 1+2+3+4+5…≠-1/12
5/20/23, 6:02 PM - Joshua Ahs: Ramanujan Summation
5/20/23, 6:03 PM - Someone: Obv
5/20/23, 6:03 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Wait
5/20/23, 6:03 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: My jc freind said it is
5/20/23, 6:03 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Just look it up
5/20/23, 6:03 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Either way
5/20/23, 6:04 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: We have true infinity
5/20/23, 6:04 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Which if I'm not wrong
5/20/23, 6:04 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Is the sum of all positive numbers
5/20/23, 6:04 PM - Joshua Ahs: Including all fractions and decimals
5/20/23, 6:04 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Like 0.00000000…1+0.00…1+0.00…1……
5/20/23, 6:04 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Ya
5/20/23, 6:04 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: True infitit is impossible to perceive
5/20/23, 6:05 PM - Joshua Ahs: But shouldn't the true true infinity be 0
5/20/23, 6:05 PM - Joshua Ahs: Because that's the sum of e everything
5/20/23, 6:06 PM - Someone: Ye
5/20/23, 6:06 PM - Someone: Um
5/20/23, 6:06 PM - Someone: Idek wat yall saying
5/20/23, 6:05 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: If I'm not wrong
5/20/23, 6:05 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: ∞ is the sum of all POSITIVE numbers
5/20/23, 6:06 PM - Someone: Yes
5/20/23, 6:06 PM - Someone: Wait
5/20/23, 6:06 PM - Joshua Ahs: Yeah
5/20/23, 6:06 PM - Someone: Oh cmon
5/20/23, 6:06 PM - Someone: Wait a minute
5/20/23, 6:06 PM - Someone: But
5/20/23, 6:07 PM - Someone: All positive includes infinty
5/20/23, 6:07 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Infinity is not a number
5/20/23, 6:07 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: It is a concept
5/20/23, 6:07 PM - Someone: Ik
5/20/23, 6:07 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Therefore we cannot add infinity
5/20/23, 6:07 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Therefore this is wrong
5/20/23, 6:07 PM - Joshua Ahs: <Media omitted>
5/20/23, 6:07 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Infidelity ofc
5/20/23, 6:08 PM - Joshua Ahs: It's an idea
5/20/23, 6:08 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Ya
5/20/23, 6:08 PM - Joshua Ahs: ~like you to wei han~
5/20/23, 6:08 PM - Someone: But
5/20/23, 6:08 PM - Someone: It's included as positive
5/20/23, 6:08 PM - Someone: So infinity being all pos is wrong
5/20/23, 6:09 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: How so
5/20/23, 6:09 PM - Someone: .
5/20/23, 6:09 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: ?
5/20/23, 6:09 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Actually since 1+2+3+4+5… is -1/12
5/20/23, 6:09 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Then what is infinity
5/20/23, 6:09 PM - Someone: Ou how
5/20/23, 6:09 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Why am I confusing myself lmao
5/20/23, 6:10 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I heard
5/20/23, 6:10 PM - Joshua Ahs: ~Awak sangat suka mencium lelaki lain.~
5/20/23, 6:10 PM - Someone: Wait
5/20/23, 6:10 PM - Someone: Then
5/20/23, 6:10 PM - Someone: Infinity wouldn't be possible
5/20/23, 6:10 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: It isn't
5/20/23, 6:10 PM - Someone: But again
5/20/23, 6:10 PM - Someone: If this is true
5/20/23, 6:10 PM - Someone: Then add them all up
5/20/23, 6:11 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I'll revisit this later
5/20/23, 6:11 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I'm gonna eat dinner
5/20/23, 6:11 PM - Joshua Ahs: So aleph null isn't real
5/20/23, 6:11 PM - Joshua Ahs: So early?
5/20/23, 6:11 PM - Someone: Can care explain whats aleph null
5/20/23, 6:12 PM - Someone: It's a neg no
5/20/23, 6:12 PM - Someone: And that's the dist
5/20/23, 6:12 PM - Joshua Ahs: 1+2+3...
5/20/23, 6:12 PM - Someone: So mathematically dist is still neg
5/20/23, 6:12 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Um
5/20/23, 6:12 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I'll ask my friend
5/20/23, 6:13 PM - Someone: Ok
5/20/23, 6:13 PM - Joshua Ahs: The jc one?
5/20/23, 6:13 PM - Someone: Lolz
5/20/23, 6:13 PM - Someone: Joshua
5/20/23, 6:14 PM - Someone: I don't think we shld confuse the rest here
5/20/23, 6:14 PM - Someone: Their brain might not take it
5/20/23, 6:14 PM - Joshua Ahs: Both aleph null and ramanujan summation are opposing views
5/20/23, 6:14 PM - Joshua Ahs: Ok
5/20/23, 6:14 PM - Someone: Oh
5/20/23, 6:15 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Wait
5/20/23, 6:15 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Back to the first thing u said
5/20/23, 6:16 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: ∞=-∞
5/20/23, 6:16 PM - Someone: Yes
5/20/23, 6:16 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: So distance can be negative ONLY IF the distance is ∞
5/20/23, 6:16 PM - Someone: No
5/20/23, 6:16 PM - Someone: I said they r interchangeable
5/20/23, 6:16 PM - Someone: Yes
5/20/23, 6:16 PM - Someone: But that is still neg
5/20/23, 6:17 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: However the distance is NOT∞
5/20/23, 6:17 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Hence
5/20/23, 6:17 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Speed must be positive
5/20/23, 6:17 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Unless it is infinity
5/20/23, 6:17 PM - Someone: Bro
5/20/23, 6:17 PM - Joshua Ahs: No
5/20/23, 6:17 PM - Someone: He asked the class if distance can be negative
5/20/23, 6:17 PM - Someone: And said no
5/20/23, 6:17 PM - Joshua Ahs: Speed is distance/time
5/20/23, 6:17 PM - Someone: So I wanted to challenge
5/20/23, 6:17 PM - Someone: And if time could be neg
5/20/23, 6:17 PM - Joshua Ahs: It can
5/20/23, 6:18 PM - Joshua Ahs: It could
5/20/23, 6:18 PM - Joshua Ahs: I meant
5/20/23, 6:18 PM - Joshua Ahs: We don't know what happens faster than the speed of light
5/20/23, 6:18 PM - Someone: Yes
5/20/23, 6:18 PM - Someone: So if we r faster
5/20/23, 6:18 PM - Someone: There's a possibility of reversing time
5/20/23, 6:18 PM - Someone: Or time travel
5/20/23, 6:18 PM - Joshua Ahs: Time slows down as we move faster
5/20/23, 6:19 PM - Someone: Then time will have a loophole
5/20/23, 6:19 PM - Someone: Then that may be when it tries to revert itself
5/20/23, 6:19 PM - Someone: Negativity
5/20/23, 6:19 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Not possible
5/20/23, 6:19 PM - Someone: Ik
5/20/23, 6:19 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: True time dilation,
5/20/23, 6:19 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: However
5/20/23, 6:19 PM - Someone: But a machinery
5/20/23, 6:19 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: We cannot reach >the speed of light
5/20/23, 6:19 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Do
5/20/23, 6:19 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: So
5/20/23, 6:19 PM - Someone: Ik
5/20/23, 6:19 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Time cannot be negative either
5/20/23, 6:20 PM - Someone: But we can in a few years
5/20/23, 6:20 PM - Someone: .
5/20/23, 6:20 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: No!
5/20/23, 6:20 PM - Someone: Hundred
5/20/23, 6:20 PM - Someone: Becuz we managed to go faster than sound
5/20/23, 6:20 PM - Someone: Which was originally thought to be impossible
5/20/23, 6:20 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Speed of sound is slower than speed of light
5/20/23, 6:21 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Thermodynamics say the speed of light is fastest
5/20/23, 6:21 PM - Joshua Ahs: We could
5/20/23, 6:21 PM - Someone: Wait
5/20/23, 6:21 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: No Idts...
5/20/23, 6:21 PM - Someone: Then how did supernova bend light?
5/20/23, 6:21 PM - Someone: Black holes I meant
5/20/23, 6:22 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Gravity?
5/20/23, 6:22 PM - Joshua Ahs: <Media omitted>
5/20/23, 6:22 PM - Joshua Ahs: Also this the proof that faster than light travel
5/20/23, 6:22 PM - Someone: Huh
5/20/23, 6:22 PM - Joshua Ahs: Will cause time travel
5/20/23, 6:23 PM - Someone: Idk abt it but I thought it was possible
5/20/23, 6:23 PM - Someone: Now
5/20/23, 6:23 PM - Joshua Ahs: Also the name for a theoretical faster than light particle is a Tachyon
5/20/23, 6:23 PM - Someone: Tachyon
5/20/23, 6:23 PM - Someone: I've heard of that
5/20/23, 6:24 PM - Someone: What isot exactly
5/20/23, 6:24 PM - Someone: Convert that to kinetic energy
5/20/23, 6:24 PM - Someone: Bam
5/20/23, 6:25 PM - Someone: The kinetic energy will be insanely high
5/20/23, 6:25 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Light isn't matter
5/20/23, 6:25 PM - Joshua Ahs: Gravity isn't even energy
5/20/23, 6:25 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: It's a wave
5/20/23, 6:25 PM - Someone: Ik
5/20/23, 6:25 PM - Joshua Ahs: It's gravitational potential energy
5/20/23, 6:25 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: So what kinetic energy
5/20/23, 6:25 PM - Someone: Around 3 trillion meters per sec
5/20/23, 6:25 PM - Someone: Uhm
5/20/23, 6:26 PM - Someone: I meant the blackhole
5/20/23, 6:26 PM - Someone: Yes that's what I meant
5/20/23, 6:26 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Kinetic energy of??
5/20/23, 6:26 PM - Someone: .
5/20/23, 6:26 PM - Someone: Gravitational force is just the force
5/20/23, 6:26 PM - Someone: GPS is the amount
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Joshua Ahs: <Media omitted>
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Someone: Layman terms, strength
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Joshua Ahs: This will calculate the energy
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Actually can we stop arguing
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Someone: V as in velocity?
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Someone: No
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Just accept
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Joshua Ahs: As you know energy must be real
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Ppl phones are dying
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Someone: Me and Joshua must make it possible
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Ight
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Someone: So we can finally roast Mr teo
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Then I'll stop arguing
5/20/23, 6:27 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Consult w Mr teo urself
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Someone: I said there's a gc
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Someone: I made
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Someone: Only 3 of us
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I left
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Joshua Ahs: Same
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Cus I only have limited storage space
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Someone: Same
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Joshua Ahs: Unlike @6586965532
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Joshua Ahs: He has so much
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Someone: But I got 150 gb more
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Like srsly
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I only have <.5gb
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Someone: 5f
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Someone: Tf
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Someone: How
5/20/23, 6:28 PM - Someone: Bro
5/20/23, 6:29 PM - Someone: U r a legend
5/20/23, 6:29 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Total my phone only has 64fb
5/20/23, 6:29 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Gb
5/20/23, 6:29 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I've seen ppl
5/20/23, 6:29 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: 16gb
5/20/23, 6:29 PM - Someone: 256 here
5/20/23, 6:29 PM - Someone: 😎
5/20/23, 6:29 PM - Joshua Ahs: Sane
5/20/23, 6:29 PM - Joshua Ahs: Same
5/20/23, 6:29 PM - Someone: Uhm
5/20/23, 6:29 PM - Joshua Ahs: Stop being so rich
5/20/23, 6:30 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Oh yeah @everyoneelse so sorry for the spam
5/20/23, 6:30 PM - Joshua Ahs: I'm partially sorry
5/20/23, 6:30 PM - Joshua Ahs: But not really
5/20/23, 6:30 PM - Joshua Ahs: and if the velocity of the thing is above the speed of light, v^2/c^2 is more than 1
5/20/23, 6:30 PM - Someone: Uhm if we can make a singularity
5/20/23, 6:30 PM - Joshua Ahs: 1-a number more than 1 is negative
5/20/23, 6:31 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Apologisoh on our behalf
5/20/23, 6:31 PM - Someone: Yes
5/20/23, 6:31 PM - Someone: Yes
5/20/23, 6:31 PM - Joshua Ahs: The square root of a negative number is imaginary
5/20/23, 6:31 PM - Joshua Ahs: Yes
5/20/23, 6:31 PM - Someone: We can make an infinitely dense matter
5/20/23, 6:32 PM - Someone: WHICH PROVES INFINITY BEING TRUE
5/20/23, 6:32 PM - Joshua Ahs: And since energy must be real, mc^2 must be imaginary
5/20/23, 6:32 PM - Someone: Cause singularity is found in blackholes
5/20/23, 6:32 PM - Someone: Also
5/20/23, 6:32 PM - Joshua Ahs: As imaginary/imaginary= real
5/20/23, 6:32 PM - Someone: Convert this to kinetic enrgy
5/20/23, 6:32 PM - Someone: Ues
5/20/23, 6:32 PM - Joshua Ahs: How
5/20/23, 6:32 PM - Someone: Wait no
5/20/23, 6:32 PM - Someone: Idk yet
5/20/23, 6:33 PM - Someone: But if possible
5/20/23, 6:33 PM - Joshua Ahs: Since c is a constant, m must be imaginary
5/20/23, 6:33 PM - Someone: Tachyon is formed
5/20/23, 6:33 PM - Joshua Ahs: Which means mass is negative
5/20/23, 6:33 PM - Joshua Ahs: I meant imaginary
5/20/23, 6:33 PM - Joshua Ahs: It is true
5/20/23, 6:33 PM - Joshua Ahs: It's mass is imaginary
5/20/23, 6:35 PM - Joshua Ahs: And if it's formed, negative time is possible
5/20/23, 6:35 PM - Joshua Ahs: And since distance/time is speed
5/20/23, 6:35 PM - Joshua Ahs: Negative speed is possible
5/20/23, 6:42 PM - Joshua Ahs: Also I apologise for the spamming
5/20/23, 6:46 PM - Someone: Yea Joshua it's clear now
5/20/23, 6:48 PM - Someone: OH
5/20/23, 6:48 PM - Someone: Ok
5/20/23, 6:50 PM - Someone: Wait so tachyon is imaginary
5/20/23, 6:50 PM - Someone: It's mass is too
5/20/23, 6:50 PM - Someone: And speed of light is constant
5/20/23, 6:54 PM - Joshua Ahs: No
5/20/23, 6:55 PM - Joshua Ahs: But the square root of 1-tachyon^2/c^2 is
5/20/23, 7:25 PM - Someone: Huh
5/20/23, 7:25 PM - Someone: 1 minus tachyon squared over speed of light squared
5/20/23, 7:26 PM - Jayden Cheng: bro
5/20/23, 7:26 PM - Jayden Cheng: i thought no math was allowed here
5/20/23, 7:26 PM - Jayden Cheng: isnt there a seperate chat for that
5/20/23, 7:26 PM - Someone: This not math
5/20/23, 7:26 PM - Someone: This physics
5/20/23, 7:27 PM - Joshua Ahs: There isn't
5/20/23, 7:27 PM - Jayden Cheng: bruh
5/20/23, 7:27 PM - Joshua Ahs: Yeah
5/20/23, 7:27 PM - Jayden Cheng: i thought yall made one
5/20/23, 7:27 PM - Someone: And they quit
5/20/23, 7:27 PM - Jayden Cheng: ah
5/20/23, 7:27 PM - Jayden Cheng: then why yall typing here
5/20/23, 7:27 PM - Jayden Cheng: cant yall make a seperate one
5/20/23, 7:27 PM - Joshua Ahs: Because this is physics
5/20/23, 7:27 PM - Joshua Ahs: Not maths
5/20/23, 7:27 PM - Someone: J9shua wanna play with ayll
5/20/23, 7:27 PM - Jayden Cheng: ye but
5/20/23, 7:27 PM - Jayden Cheng: its spamming my notifs
5/20/23, 7:28 PM - Someone: Mute lah
5/20/23, 7:28 PM - Jayden Cheng: so try not to spamm all
5/20/23, 7:28 PM - Jayden Cheng: bro what u think ive been doing
5/20/23, 7:28 PM - Someone: Also it's necessary
5/20/23, 7:28 PM - Someone: We needed to get back at Mr teo
5/20/23, 7:28 PM - Jayden Cheng: then make a seperate chat
5/20/23, 7:28 PM - Someone: By proving that -speed is possible
5/20/23, 7:29 PM - Jayden Cheng: huh
5/20/23, 7:29 PM - Jayden Cheng: what
5/20/23, 7:29 PM - Someone: Yes
5/20/23, 7:29 PM - Jayden Cheng: liek why
5/20/23, 7:29 PM - Someone: Due to negative time being possoble
5/20/23, 8:08 PM - Jasson Ahs: No, if we make an extra chat for every random topic we talk for too long we'll lose the record for the class with the most used group chat
5/20/23, 8:10 PM - Kaeleb Ahs: hi
5/20/23, 8:11 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Bye
5/20/23, 8:36 PM - Joshua Ahs: How would you know
5/20/23, 8:40 PM - Jasson Ahs: Inference
5/20/23, 8:40 PM - Joshua Ahs: Where's the evidence
5/20/23, 8:40 PM - Joshua Ahs: Explanation
5/20/23, 8:41 PM - Joshua Ahs: Contextual Knowledge
5/20/23, 8:41 PM - Joshua Ahs: Link
5/20/23, 8:42 PM - Jasson Ahs: According to calculations more than 99% of texts in this chat have been about this random topic
5/20/23, 8:43 PM - Jasson Ahs: Which means that we will have only 1% of our normal texts
5/20/23, 8:44 PM - Jasson Ahs: Which is 20-50 texts per day
5/20/23, 8:44 PM - Jasson Ahs: From my contextual knowledge, most other classes have more than that
5/20/23, 8:46 PM - Jasson Ahs: Hence when getting rid of these dumb messages we will have less texts average than other classes
5/20/23, 8:48 PM - Jasson Ahs: Our insanity, stupidity, incompetence and our lack of logical thinking coupled with the need to win every argument is the only reason why we have this record
5/20/23, 8:49 PM - Someone: Wrong, wrong, wrong
5/20/23, 8:49 PM - Kaeleb Ahs: ok
5/20/23, 9:09 PM - Jasson Ahs: What is wrong about it
5/20/23, 9:20 PM - Someone: We r smart
5/20/23, 9:21 PM - Someone: And um
5/20/23, 9:21 PM - Someone: Abit too
5/20/23, 9:23 PM - Jasson Ahs: Fine, some of us are
5/20/23, 9:23 PM - Jasson Ahs: But not you
5/20/23, 9:29 PM - Someone: Hmmmm
5/20/23, 9:29 PM - Someone: HMMMMMMMM
5/20/23, 9:30 PM - Someone: Says u
5/20/23, 9:30 PM - Someone: Bro said us when he is the dumbest
5/20/23, 9:51 PM - Jasson Ahs: Hunger games is tomorrow btw
5/20/23, 10:27 PM - Jasson Ahs: Guys, I just did the hunger games
5/20/23, 10:28 PM - Jasson Ahs: I have the screenshots
5/20/23, 10:28 PM - Jasson Ahs: The results are shocking
5/20/23, 10:28 PM - Jasson Ahs: I swear it isn't rigged
5/20/23, 10:38 PM - Joshua Ahs: No
5/20/23, 10:38 PM - Joshua Ahs: I will not approve of this
5/20/23, 10:38 PM - Joshua Ahs: I am still coding my version
5/20/23, 10:43 PM - Someone: Sigh
5/20/23, 10:44 PM - Someone: I bet this fight ain't worth it
5/20/23, 10:44 PM - Someone: Or at least, ik who's gonna win
5/20/23, 10:44 PM - Someone: POLL:
Is the glass
OPTION: Half full (0 votes)
OPTION: Half empty (1 vote)

5/20/23, 10:45 PM - +65 8919 3018: what is the glass
5/20/23, 10:46 PM - Someone: Ok
5/20/23, 10:46 PM - Someone: Imagine a glass that can hold 250ml

5/21/23, 7:03 PM - Jasson Ahs: Fight back
5/21/23, 7:03 PM - Joshua Ahs: Arise ye workers from your slumbers
Arise ye prisoners of want
For reason in revolt now thunders
And at last ends the age of cant.
Away with all your superstitions
Servile masses arise, arise
We’ll change henceforth the old tradition
And spurn the dust to win the prize.

Refrain:
So comrades, come rally
And the last fight let us face
The Internationale unites the human race.

No more deluded by reaction
On tyrants only we’ll make war
The soldiers too will take strike action
They’ll break ranks and fight no more
And if those cannibals keep trying
To sacrifice us to their pride
They soon shall hear the bullets flying
We’ll shoot the generals on our own side.

No saviour from on high delivers
No faith have we in prince or peer
Our own right hand the chains must shiver
Chains of hatred, greed and fear
E’er the thieves will out with their booty
And give to all a happier lot.
Each at the forge must do their duty
And we’ll strike while the iron is hot.
5/21/23, 7:04 PM - Jasson Ahs: Rebel!

5/21/23, 7:23 PM - Jasson Ahs: @6596716538 and me deserve to be in the same power they are
5/21/23, 7:24 PM - Jasson Ahs: Cuz it will have a different outcome

Ты знаешь правила, как и я
В полном объем о чём я думаю
Ты не получишь это от другого парня
Я просто хочу рассказать тебе, что я чувствую
Я чувствую, что должен дать тебе понять
 
(Хорус)
Никогда тебя не брошу
Никогда тебя не подведу
Никогда тебя не оставлю и от тебя не уйду
Никогда не заставлю тебя плакать
Никогда не скажу "прощай"
Никогда не совру и не сделаю тебе больно
 
Мы знаем друг друга так долго
Твоё сердце болит, но ты слишком скромна, чтобы сказать это
Внутри мы оба знаем что происходит
Мы знаем игру и мы хотим сыграть в неё
И если ты спросишь меня что я чувствую
Не говори мне, что ты слишком слепа, чтобы увидеть
 
(Хорус х2)
 
(Брошу, брошу)
Никогда не брошу, никогда не брошу
(Потеряю)
Никогда не брошу, никогда не брошу
(Брошу)
 
Мы знаем друг друга так долго
Твоё сердце болит, но ты слишком скромна, чтобы сказать это
Внутри мы оба знаем что происходит
Мы знаем игру и мы хотим сыграть в неё
Я просто хочу тебе рассказать, что я чувствую
Должен дать тебе понять
 
(Хорус х3)

5/22/23, 4:20 PM - Joshua Ahs: The one where there is a Jasson x Vera arc, where first, Jasson is gay with Jayden, and Vera is thinking about her ex. But then Joshua orders Vera to kill Jasson. She kills Joshua instead. Jasson probably had a crush on Vera after that. Vera then gets into a pretend wedding with Emma Chua. A few days later, Vera kissed Yu Wei, and there was a tsunami then. Then, Jasson catches Yu Wei with a rope, slashes him with a spear, and sets grenades on him. After that, Rheia walks in on Vera and Jasson doing weird and sus things and kills herself in disgust. Vera then attempts to kiss Jasson.
5/22/23, 4:21 PM - Jasson Ahs: WTF
5/22/23, 4:21 PM - Jasson Ahs: It's random

5/22/23, 10:34 PM - Joshua Ahs: ~In the hunger games simulator, there is a Jasson x Vera arc, where first, Jasson is gay with Jayden, and Vera is thinking about her ex. But then Joshua orders Vera to kill Jasson. She kills Joshua instead. Jasson probably had a crush on Vera after that. Vera then gets into a pretend wedding with Emma Chua. A few days later, Vera kissed Yu Wei, and there was a tsunami then. Then, Jasson catches Yu Wei with a rope, slashes him with a spear, and sets grenades on him. After that, Rheia walks in on Vera and Jasson doing weird and sus things and kills herself in disgust. Vera then attempts to kiss Jasson. Then, Nathanial died after blushing so much.~

5/24/23, 4:37 PM - Jasson Ahs: Am I allowed to say $h*t
5/24/23, 4:38 PM - Jasson Ahs: The show is obviously used to promote to young girls to do as a female is stereotyped to do in the eyes of the society
5/24/23, 4:39 PM - +65 8910 1503: My little pony g4 had multiple movies, a spin-off series and 9 seasons, it sold a shit load of toys for Hasbro and made a shit load of streaming money

5/24/23, 4:41 PM - Jasson Ahs: All the main characters are female
5/24/23, 4:41 PM - Jasson Ahs: Except the dragon thing
5/24/23, 4:41 PM - +65 8910 1503: So is it sexist against men or women?
5/24/23, 4:41 PM - Jasson Ahs: Which is still stereotyping
5/24/23, 4:41 PM - Jasson Ahs: Both
5/24/23, 4:42 PM - +65 8910 1503: How is a dragon being a male streotyping

5/24/23, 4:45 PM - +65 8910 1503: are you the akinator or something
5/24/23, 4:46 PM - Jasson Ahs: Ace Ventura and the mask is better than the truman show
5/24/23, 4:47 PM - Jasson Ahs: You earlier said Truman is the best show of all time
5/24/23, 4:47 PM - Jasson Ahs: Which is also false
5/24/23, 4:48 PM - +65 8910 1503: best show not my favourite show
5/24/23, 4:49 PM - Jasson Ahs: I know but the fourth best is not the favorite

Intentionally induces a deceived victim into either doing anything that he would not do if he had not been deceived, or omitting to do something that he would have done if he had not been deceived. The acts or omissions must also cause, or must be likely to cause, damage or harm to any person in body, mind, reputation or property.

5/29/23, 6:10 PM - Joshua Ahs: ~Arise ye workers from your slumbers Arise ye prisoners of want For reason in revolt now thunders And at last ends the age of cant. Away with all your superstitions Servile masses arise, arise We’ll change henceforth the old tradition And spurn the dust to win the prize. Refrain: So comrades, come rally And the last fight let us face The Internationale unites the human race. No more deluded by reaction On tyrants only we’ll make war The soldiers too will take strike action They’ll break ranks and fight no more And if those cannibals keep trying To sacrifice us to their pride They soon shall hear the bullets flying We’ll shoot the generals on our own side. No saviour from on high delivers No faith have we in prince or peer Our own right hand the chains must shiver Chains of hatred, greed and fear E’er the thieves will out with their booty And give to all a happier lot. Each at the forge must do their duty And we’ll strike while the iron is hot.~

6/7/23, 9:05 PM - Kaeleb Ahs: Hmm
6/7/23, 9:10 PM - Joshua Ahs: Time to do the democracy test for this group chat to see if it's a democracy or an authoritarian state
6/7/23, 9:10 PM - Joshua Ahs: 1. Are elections for the national legislature and head of government free? 
Consider whether elections are competitive in that electors are free to vote and 
are offered a range of choices. 
1: Essentially unrestricted conditions for the presentation of candidates (for 
example, no bans on major parties) 
0.5: There are some restrictions on the electoral process 
0: A single-party system or major impediments exist (for example, bans on a 
major party or candidate)
6/7/23, 9:11 PM - Joshua Ahs: I'll give 0 because there are no elections we get to take part in
6/7/23, 9:12 PM - Joshua Ahs: In fact, since there are no elections at all, I'll give 0 for every question which asks about them
6/7/23, 9:14 PM - Joshua Ahs: So that means 0 for most questions in section 1
6/7/23, 9:15 PM - Joshua Ahs: If they are not 0, I will write them down:
11. Is potential access to public office open to all citizens? 
1: Yes 
0.5: Formally unrestricted, but in practice restricted for some groups, or for 
citizens from some parts of the country 
0: No
6/7/23, 9:15 PM - Joshua Ahs: I'll give it 0.5
6/7/23, 9:17 PM - Joshua Ahs: So this group chat gets a 0.5/12 for Electoral process and
pluralism
6/7/23, 9:17 PM - Joshua Ahs: Next section
6/7/23, 9:18 PM - Joshua Ahs: Question 13 about elections so 0
6/7/23, 9:19 PM - Joshua Ahs: 14. Is the legislature the supreme political body, with a clear supremacy over 
other branches of government?

6/10/23, 10:52 PM - Joshua Ahs: DuckTales
6/10/23, 10:52 PM - Jasson Ahs: How dare you
6/10/23, 10:52 PM - Jasson Ahs: Liar
6/10/23, 10:53 PM - Joshua Ahs: The WW2 Disney Films including Donald Duck were much better
6/10/23, 10:53 PM - Jasson Ahs: Yes
6/10/23, 10:53 PM - Jasson Ahs: Saludos Amigos and the Three Cabelleros are the best
6/10/23, 10:53 PM - Jasson Ahs: I love those movies
6/10/23, 10:54 PM - Jasson Ahs: Also did you know the characters from those movies made side characters in a few of the episodes in DuckTales
6/10/23, 10:54 PM - Jasson Ahs: They even had their own episode
6/10/23, 10:55 PM - Joshua Ahs: I meant the WW2 American propaganda ones
6/10/23, 10:55 PM - Jasson Ahs: The other WW2 movies were not as good tho
6/10/23, 10:55 PM - Joshua Ahs: But those films are as goofb

6/10/23, 10:56 PM - Joshua Ahs: Soviet animation is also good
6/10/23, 10:56 PM - Jasson Ahs: The one with Donald simping for all the Mexican women
6/10/23, 10:57 PM - Jasson Ahs: It's the same but cheaper
6/10/23, 10:57 PM - Joshua Ahs: No
6/10/23, 10:58 PM - Jasson Ahs: They had worse animation due to most of the team going to war
6/10/23, 10:58 PM - Joshua Ahs: But the prewar was good ll
6/10/23, 10:58 PM - Joshua Ahs: Like 1938
6/10/23, 11:00 PM - Joshua Ahs: But during the war the quality was also ok
6/10/23, 11:00 PM - Jasson Ahs: That was the year after the first animated movie was created

6/10/23, 11:01 PM - Joshua Ahs: Oh
6/10/23, 11:01 PM - Jasson Ahs: It's very different
6/10/23, 11:01 PM - Joshua Ahs: Soviet was better
6/10/23, 11:02 PM - Jasson Ahs: Also why is it in black and white
6/10/23, 11:02 PM - Joshua Ahs: But American is also good
6/10/23, 11:02 PM - Joshua Ahs: Because Russia was being invaded
6/10/23, 11:02 PM - Joshua Ahs: Before the war there were colour Russian oned
6/10/23, 11:03 PM - Joshua Ahs: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Grandfather_Ivan.webm

6/19/23, 10:21 PM - Someone: Rjrnbrrb
6/19/23, 10:29 PM - Joshua Ahs: Dear Yu Wei,

I understand that you are requesting someone's help in obtaining the assigned questions for the geography holiday homework given by our geography teacher, Ms. Tok. However, I regret to inform you that I will not be able to fulfill your request.

Assignments and homework serve as valuable learning opportunities and are designed to enhance our understanding of the subject matter. By completing these tasks independently, we develop crucial skills such as research, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. It is essential for our academic growth and personal development that we actively engage in the learning process.

While it may be tempting to seek assistance or rely on others for answers, it is important to remember that the purpose of the homework is to assess our individual understanding and progress. By attempting the questions ourselves, we are better equipped to comprehend and retain the information provided in the curriculum. Additionally, we can seek clarification from our teacher if we encounter any difficulties or have specific questions regarding the assignment.

By taking ownership of our academic responsibilities, we demonstrate our commitment to our education and growth. The effort we invest in completing our homework will contribute to our overall success and achievements in the subject.

Therefore, I encourage you to approach the geography holiday homework with a positive attitude and embrace the learning opportunities it presents. I believe that with diligent effort and a genuine interest in the subject, you will be able to accomplish the assigned questions successfully and derive the utmost benefit from the exercise.

Should you encounter any challenges or require guidance during the process, I recommend reaching out to Ms. Tok or your classmates for support. Collaboration and communication within the classroom environment can foster a sense of camaraderie and facilitate mutual learning experiences.

Remember, education is not merely about obtaining answers, but about the journey of acquiring knowledge and developing essential skills. Embracing this mindset will undoubtedly contribute to your growth as a student and a well-rounded individual.

Wishing you the best of luck with your geography holiday homework!

Sincerely,
Joshua Tan Shao Jie

6/19/23, 10:32 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I understand completely your concern on my self-sufficiency, however I did not ask for answers to fill in. Instead, my intention was to receive acquisition of the questions owing to the fact that I had not bought it to my place of residence before the June holidays and it is laying under my desk in Anglican high school. I intend to jot down my own answers on a piece of paper, them transfer my words unto the worksheet handed upon us
6/19/23, 10:32 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: YES HES CORRECT
6/19/23, 10:36 PM - Someone: You deleted this message
6/19/23, 10:36 PM - Joshua Ahs: Thank you for clarifying your intention regarding the acquisition of the geography holiday homework questions. However, I must address the concerns raised by your response, as they seem to contradict certain facts and raise doubts about the validity of your claim. Firstly, your explanation suggests that you had not brought the worksheet to your place of residence before the holidays. In most cases, students are responsible for carrying their homework and assignments home, especially if they are expected to work on them during holiday periods. It raises questions as to why you would have left the worksheet behind, particularly if it is a vital component of your academic responsibilities. While I understand that unforeseen circumstances or forgetfulness can occur, it is important to ensure the accuracy and credibility of the information provided. In this case, the details you have presented seem dubious and lack supporting evidence. Given the aforementioned points, it appears that your statement regarding the location of the worksheet and your intention to complete it independently may not align with reality. It is crucial to maintain honesty and integrity in academic matters, as they are integral to personal growth and the pursuit of knowledge. I would encourage you to reconsider your approach to the situation and explore alternative means of obtaining the worksheet. It may be appropriate to reach out to your geography teacher, Ms. Tok, or a classmate who may have a copy of the assignment. Open communication and seeking assistance through proper channels will ensure that you can fulfill your academic responsibilities in a genuine and accountable manner. Remember, honesty and sincerity are fundamental principles in the pursuit of education, and it is essential to uphold these values as we navigate our academic journey.
6/19/23, 10:36 PM - Joshua Ahs: YOU'RE LYING
6/19/23, 10:37 PM - AHS Christopher: Heh
6/19/23, 10:37 PM - Jasson Ahs: True
6/19/23, 10:38 PM - Joshua Ahs: I do not have a copy btw
6/19/23, 10:40 PM - Joshua Ahs: I meant that I regret to inform you that I do not possess a copy of the assigned homework at this time. Moreover, I would like to bring to your attention that I am unable to offer any assistance regarding it.
6/19/23, 10:41 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I understand your intention to bring forth goodwill and value unto me, however I solemnly swear that my worksheet is under my desk
6/19/23, 10:42 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Henceforth I am requesting in a group chat of 1c that any student can give me the questions
6/19/23, 10:42 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I am not asking for the answers
6/19/23, 10:43 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Therefore I am requesting that you either type out the questions or blank out the answers
6/19/23, 10:43 PM - Joshua Ahs: I extend my sincerest apologies for entertaining the notion that you were being untruthful.
6/19/23, 10:43 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I gratefully thank any student capable of meeting my requests
6/19/23, 10:44 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Regardless, good night to all humans here
6/19/23, 10:44 PM - Joshua Ahs: However, I must express my regret as I currently find myself without a copy of the assigned homework.
6/19/23, 10:44 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Ah
6/19/23, 10:45 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: So how many you be able to finish your work of not rushing it in the early school hours
6/19/23, 10:46 PM - Joshua Ahs: Allow me to clarify that I have indeed completed my homework as required
6/19/23, 10:46 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Such speed
6/19/23, 10:46 PM - Joshua Ahs: However, due to unforeseen circumstances, I have regrettably misplaced it
6/19/23, 10:47 PM - Joshua Ahs: In actuality, I diligently undertook the task of completing the assigned homework well in advance.
6/19/23, 10:48 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Ah
6/19/23, 10:49 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: I see
6/19/23, 10:49 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Therefore I shall wish everyone a good night and advise you all that you all should sleep at an earlier hour
6/19/23, 10:52 PM - Joshua Ahs: In light of the aforementioned statement, I must express my intention to deviate from the suggested course of action made by you
6/19/23, 10:52 PM - Joshua Ahs: Therefore, I hereby declare that I shall not partake in the act of retiring to bed at an earlier hour, as advised by you
6/19/23, 10:53 PM - Joshua Ahs: Instead, I plan to engage in activities that will extend my wakefulness until the late hour of 1 a.m., at which point I shall finally seek retirement to bed

6/21/23, 1:37 PM - Joshua Ahs: Dear clone of Yu Wei (Christopher)

I understand that you are requesting someone's help in obtaining what you should include as the content to be displayed on my poster for the Chinese book-related holiday homework activity that you are participating in. However, I regret to inform you that I will not be able to fulfill your request.

Assignments and homework serve as valuable learning opportunities and are designed to enhance our understanding of the subject matter. By completing these tasks independently, we develop crucial skills such as research, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. It is essential for our academic growth and personal development that we actively engage in the learning process.

While it may be tempting to seek assistance or rely on others for answers, it is important to remember that the purpose of the homework is to assess our individual understanding and progress. By attempting the questions ourselves, we are better equipped to comprehend and retain the information provided in the curriculum. Additionally, we can seek clarification from our teacher if we encounter any difficulties or have specific questions regarding the assignment.

By taking ownership of our academic responsibilities, we demonstrate our commitment to our education and growth. The effort we invest in completing our homework will contribute to our overall success and achievements in the subject.

Therefore, I encourage you to approach the Chinese holiday homework with a positive attitude and embrace the learning opportunities it presents. I believe that with diligent effort and a genuine interest in the subject, you will be able to accomplish the assigned questions successfully and derive the utmost benefit from the exercise.

Should you encounter any challenges or require guidance during the process, I recommend reaching out to Foongsa or your classmates for support. Collaboration and communication within the classroom environment can foster a sense of camaraderie and facilitate mutual learning experiences.

Remember, education is not merely about obtaining answers, but about the journey of acquiring knowledge and developing essential skills. Embracing this mindset will undoubtedly contribute to your growth as a student and a well-rounded individual.

Wishing you the best of luck with your Chinese holiday homework!

Sincerely,
Joshua Tan Shao Jie
6/21/23, 1:42 PM - Jasson Ahs: This is the same as the other one
6/21/23, 1:43 PM - AHS Christopher: Bruh
6/21/23, 1:43 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Na I didnt even bring the ws home
6/21/23, 1:43 PM - Kaeleb Ahs: Oh my god
6/21/23, 1:44 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: And that ur here
6/21/23, 1:44 PM - Jasson Ahs: You just changed Yu Wei to clone of Yu Wei and Geography to Chinese
6/21/23, 1:44 PM - Jasson Ahs: This is the same reaction kaeleb had
6/21/23, 1:44 PM - Kaeleb Ahs: ok
6/21/23, 1:44 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Can yiu give ALL the qns of the geog hw
6/21/23, 1:44 PM - Jasson Ahs: So predictable
6/21/23, 1:44 PM - Kaeleb Ahs: <Media omitted>
6/21/23, 1:44 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: Nah it's just a Joshua moment
6/21/23, 1:52 PM - Joshua Ahs: Yes
6/21/23, 1:52 PM - Joshua Ahs: Time to make the Joshua Moment more realistic
6/21/23, 1:52 PM - Joshua Ahs: Tandas terbaik
6/21/23, 1:52 PM - Joshua Ahs: Orang yang tidak suka tandas ialah bodoh
6/21/23, 1:59 PM - Jasson Ahs: This chat is becoming stale, there are no interesting plots or plots at all most of the time it's just filler and when the writers come up with an actual plot they keep reusing it, not only that but even the dialogue is reused, the jokes are bland, uninteresting and borderline just made to fill out the run time. This occurrence is very common with long running shows such as season 7 of Brooklyn 99, season 14 of the Simpsons or season 8 of SpongeBob, however this chat has only been running for less than a year which in most shows is only halfway through season 1, this phenomenon occurs in shows with weak elements at it's core and is commonly cancelled within the first season unless new ideas are brought to the table such shows include Victorious, Hannah Montana or the office
6/21/23, 1:59 PM - Yu Wei Ahs: How you dare
6/21/23, 1:59 PM - Joshua Ahs: Im going to make a counterargument
6/21/23, 1:59 PM - Jasson Ahs: No
6/21/23, 2:00 PM - Jasson Ahs: I don't have time to make a countercounterargument
6/21/23, 2:00 PM - Joshua Ahs: Too bad
6/21/23, 2:03 PM - Jasson Ahs: Your counterargument isn't even going to be that good, I've been writing reviews for movies and shows since I was 4
6/21/23, 2:03 PM - Jasson Ahs: I once wrote a review about a Barney the dinosaur episode
6/21/23, 2:17 PM - Joshua Ahs: I understand your frustration with the state of this chat, but given that you're the kind of person who should go on a date Emma Joy than speak here, it's important to consider some counter-arguments to your point. First, it may not be entirely fair to compare this chat to a TV show. Chat interactions are fundamentally different from scripted TV episodes. The purpose of this chat is not to give or entertain a story in progress like a TV show. Rather, the main goal is to help people with their requests and participate in discussions. Therefore, it may be unrealistic to expect elaborate or unique stories in this context. Second, the time such chats last for do not necessarily determine their quality or entertainment value. This chat was made to support and discuss people on a variety of topics and is less dependent on ongoing storylines. Its value lies in creating meaningful conversations and supporting people's questions rather than relying solely on story progression. Moreover, it is not uncommon in any medium for dialogue and jokes to be reused. This chat reuses certain answers and phrases for consistency. Also, new ideas and features may emerge over time to keep the chat engaging and interesting for people. In summary, it's understandable to want more variety and novelty in this chat, but it's important to understand its primary purpose and the difference between a scripted TV show and a talk show. The value of this chat lies in having meaningful conversations and effectively supporting people, rather than relying solely on complex or unique stories.
6/21/23, 2:17 PM - Joshua Ahs: Also, the shows you mentioned are stupid
6/21/23, 2:27 PM - Jasson Ahs: How can you measure a show's intelligence
6/21/23, 2:27 PM - Jasson Ahs: What do you mean support
6/21/23, 2:28 PM - Jasson Ahs: Every time someone asks for help you write a essay on why you can't and shouldn't help them
6/21/23, 2:31 PM - Joshua Ahs: I can't help because I lost all my worksheets
6/21/23, 2:31 PM - Joshua Ahs: If you like them, they aren't intelligent
6/21/23, 2:31 PM - Joshua Ahs: For instance DuckTales
6/21/23, 2:33 PM - Jasson Ahs: Also I'm not frustrated I have no reason to be I just don't care about the chat enough to be, there is just nothing to care about, I'd much rather spend time explaining how the multiverses and universes connect in every show and movie and videogame that is ever created
6/21/23, 2:34 PM - Jasson Ahs: It's very complicated as in some universe other universes are fictional however they connect to that universe by a chain of other projects
6/21/23, 2:34 PM - Joshua Ahs: Include hoi4
6/21/23, 8:46 PM - Joshua Ahs: This message was deleted

6/21/23, 10:22 PM - Jasson Ahs: No
6/21/23, 10:22 PM - Jasson Ahs: The multiverse of multiverses connects to everything
6/21/23, 10:23 PM - Jasson Ahs: Did you know that all the Disney channel sitcoms take place in the same multiverse as the multiverse in the mcu
6/21/23, 10:25 PM - Jasson Ahs: Also so much of pop culture had already established the multiverse way before marvel
6/21/23, 10:44 PM - Joshua Ahs: If genshin impact is in the multiverse, then Yuwei is in it
6/21/23, 10:44 PM - Joshua Ahs: As everyone knows Yuwei is Venti
6/21/23, 10:46 PM - Joshua Ahs: But I realise most things in the supposed multiverse are conflicting
6/21/23, 10:47 PM - Joshua Ahs: Like for instance, some shows, movies, books, and games, especially alternate history ones (which I like), have different events happening
6/21/23, 10:56 PM - Jasson Ahs: There is contemplation that there is actually a multiverse of multiverses as shown during multiversal events in shows or movies proving that its obvious that there are several multiverses however there is just as much evidence where universes that are proven not in the multiverse be in the same universe as a universe within the multiverse
6/22/23, 7:46 AM - Kaeleb Ahs: It already is
6/22/23, 1:27 PM - Kaeleb Ahs: e

6/26/23, 2:24 PM - Joshua Ahs: Dear Mr. Tang Yuwei,

With deep regret and remorse, I humbly offer my sincerest apologies for this material oversight. Unfortunately, due to my carelessness, I have been unable to bring the math worksheets needed to finish during the school holidays, which are the math worksheets 8A, 8B, 8C,  to our educational institution today. I have to let you know that I forgot. I intended to fill out the above worksheet faithfully and submit it to our respected math teacher, Mr. Teo, so please note that this regrettable mistake was in no way intentional or constructive. But at this critical moment, my poor memory betrayed me and I made the fatal mistake of leaving the worksheet. I understand that this put you in a predicament as you were asked for these worksheets to reach Mr. Teo hands in a timely manner. I sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and inconvenience caused. In order to remedy this situation as soon as possible, I solemnly swear to pick up the above worksheet and bring it to school tomorrow. Please rest assured. I will deliver them directly to you and forward them quickly so that they can be delivered to Mr. Teo as soon as possible. I once again sincerely apologise for the erroneous decision and the resulting consequences. I recongise the importance of keeping promises and responsibilities, and I deeply regret not being able to do so in this case. I promise that we will pay more attention and attention to prevent such an unfortunate incident from happening again in the future. I appreciate your understanding and patience regarding this matter. I sincerely thank you for their cooperation and forgiveness, and am determined to make amends. If you have any other concerns or suggestions regarding this matter, please feel free to let me know.

Yours sincerely,
Joshua Tan Shao Jie

6/26/23, 3:06 PM - Someone: 5 years
6/26/23, 3:08 PM - Joshua Ahs: Two months ago, I experienced the unfortunate event of my phone being dropped from a height of about half a meter, resulting in significant internal damage. As an owner of a cheap phone, its build quality and durability were naturally inferior compared to more expensive alternatives. This situation highlights the inherent vulnerability of budget-friendly devices, which lack the robustness and resilience of higher-end smartphones. Consequently, it raises questions regarding the role of economic systems in shaping the quality and accessibility of technology. You cannot ignore the existence of inequalities when it comes to the quality and durability of different smartphones. In a capitalist society, like the one prevalent in most countries, there is a stark contrast between high-end devices offered by renowned brands and more affordable options targeting budget-conscious consumers. This disparity is often attributed to the varying levels of research, development, and premium materials used in the manufacturing process of these devices. In imagining a hypothetical scenario where communism exists in Singapore, it is essential to consider the core principles of this economic system. Communism advocates for the equitable distribution of resources and aims to eliminate disparities between individuals. In such a system, every citizen would be entitled to the same type of phone, ensuring a level playing field in terms of technology accessibility. Consequently, the extent of damage inflicted on phones would be similar across the population, as everyone would possess the same device.

The East Slavs emerged as a recognisable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries CE. The first East Slavic state, Kievan Rus', arose in the 9th century, and in 988, it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire. Rus' ultimately disintegrated, with the Grand Duchy of Moscow growing to become the Tsardom of Russia. By the early 18th century, Russia had vastly expanded through conquest, annexation, and the efforts of Russian explorers, developing into the Russian Empire, which remains the third-largest empire in history.

6/27/23, 8:55 PM - Someone: WW2 in SG: A Funny Story

Singapore was a British colony in Southeast Asia, and the British thought it was a very important place. They built a big naval base there, and put some big guns along the coast to scare away any enemies. They also called it the "Gibraltar of the East", which meant it was very strong and hard to conquer. They were very proud of their colony, and they thought nothing bad could ever happen to it.

But they were wrong. Very wrong.

In 1941, Japan decided to join the war and attack the British and their friends. Japan was very good at fighting, and they had a lot of planes, ships and soldiers. They also had a secret plan to attack Singapore from behind, through the jungles of Malaya. The British did not expect this, because they thought the jungles were too thick and too hot for anyone to walk through. They also thought their big guns could only point out to sea, and not turn around to shoot at the land.

So Japan had an easy time invading Malaya, and they reached Singapore in two months. The British were very surprised and scared, and they tried to stop them. But they were too late and too weak. They had fewer soldiers than Japan, and many of them were tired, sick or new. They also had fewer planes and ships than Japan, and many of them were old, broken or sunk. They also had less water than Japan, because Japan had captured the reservoirs on the mainland. They also had less food than Japan, because Japan had bombed their warehouses and farms.

So Japan had a hard time not laughing at them.

On February 8, 1942, Japan crossed the narrow strait that separated Singapore from Malaya, using small boats and rubber rafts. The British tried to blow up the bridge that connected the two sides, but they only made a small hole in it. Japan easily fixed it with some planks and ropes. The British tried to defend their island, but they did not know where to go or what to do. They were confused and scared, and they ran around like headless chickens.

So Japan had a fun time chasing them.

Japan attacked from the north and west of the island, where the British had left their weakest troops. Japan quickly broke through their lines and captured many places, such as Changi Airport, Paya Lebar Air Base and Geylang. The British tried to hold on to their core areas in the center and south of the island, such as Orchard Road, Marina Bay and Sentosa. But they were outnumbered and outgunned by Japan, who kept bombing and shelling them from the air and sea.

So Japan had a blast time bombing them.

The British leader in Singapore was a man named Arthur Percival. He was not very good at his job, and he made many mistakes. He did not listen to his officers or his allies, who gave him good advice. He did not send enough troops or supplies to where they were needed most. He did not use his big guns or his naval base effectively. He did not ask for help from his friends in Australia or India soon enough.

So Japan had an easy time ignoring him.

On February 15, 1942, Percival decided to give up and surrender Singapore to Japan. He walked out of his bunker with a white flag, followed by some other British officers. He met with the Japanese leader in Singapore, a man named Tomoyuki Yamashita. He was very good at his job, and he made many victories. He was also very smart and cunning, and he tricked Percival into thinking he had more troops than he really did.

So Japan had a great time fooling him.

Percival signed a paper that said he gave up all his troops and weapons to Japan. There were about 85,000 British soldiers who became prisoners of war (POWs) of Japan. This was the largest surrender in British history, and it was very shameful and sad for them. There were also many civilians who became under Japanese rule in Singapore. This was very hard and cruel for them.

So Japan had a terrible time ruling them.

The end.

6/27/23, 9:26 PM - Joshua Ahs: **The War of Singapore**

Singapore, a small island nation at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, was once a British colony and a thriving trading hub. After gaining independence in 1965, it developed into a modern and prosperous city-state with a diverse population and a strong economy. However, in the year 2023, a political crisis divided the country into two rival factions: East Singapore and West Singapore.

East Singapore was led by Lucas Thiam Chuan Quan, a weak and corrupt anticommunist leader who was bad at English and only good at Chinese. She wasted the finances of her government on liho bubble tea and was addicted to it, which was why she was fat and lived in Bedok Reservoir View. She had little support from the people, who were unhappy with her policies and her incompetence.

West Singapore was led by Joshua Tan Shao Jie, a strong and charismatic national bolshevik leader who was good at English, Maths, Science, History, Geography, and Literature. Despite being a Chinese, he could also speak Malay and was a top scorer in school. He had a loyal following of supporters who admired his vision and his skills.

The two leaders had a long history of animosity and rivalry, dating back to their school days when they competed for academic honors and popularity. They also had different ideologies and agendas for the future of Singapore. Lucas wanted to maintain the status quo and keep Singapore as a capitalist and pro-Western ally, while Joshua wanted to transform Singapore into a socialist and pro-Eastern power.

The tension between the two sides escalated when Lucas accused Joshua of plotting a coup against her and ordered his arrest. Joshua denied the accusation and declared his independence from Lucas's regime. He mobilized his forces and seized control of the western part of Singapore, including Queenstown where he lived. He proclaimed himself as the president of West Singapore and vowed to liberate the rest of the country from Lucas's tyranny.

The war began on June 28, 2023, when Lucas launched an attack on West Singapore with her army and air force. She hoped to crush Joshua's rebellion quickly and restore her authority over the whole island. However, she underestimated Joshua's strength and resilience. Joshua's troops put up a fierce resistance and repelled Lucas's invasion. They also launched counterattacks on East Singapore's positions and inflicted heavy casualties on Lucas's forces.

The war lasted for six months, during which time both sides engaged in several battles across the island. Some of the major battles were:

- The Battle of Jurong: This was the first major battle of the war, fought on June 29-30, 2023. Lucas's army attempted to capture Jurong Industrial Estate, which was West Singapore's main source of income and resources. However, they were ambushed by Joshua's guerrillas who used their knowledge of the terrain and their superior tactics to inflict heavy losses on Lucas's troops. The battle ended with a decisive victory for West Singapore.

- The Battle of Changi: This was the second major battle of the war, fought on July 15-16, 2023. Lucas's air force tried to bomb Changi Airport, which was West Singapore's main gateway to the outside world and their lifeline for supplies and reinforcements. However, they were intercepted by Joshua's fighters who used their advanced technology and their superior skills to shoot down many of Lucas's planes. The battle ended with a decisive victory for West Singapore.

- The Battle of Orchard: This was the third major battle of the war, fought on August 9-10, 2023. Lucas's army tried to capture Orchard Road, which was West Singapore's main shopping district and cultural center. However, they were met by Joshua's militia who used their urban warfare skills and their civilian support to hold off Lucas's troops. The battle ended with a stalemate.

- The Battle of Marina Bay: This was the fourth major battle of the war, fought on September 23-24, 2023. Lucas's navy tried to blockade Marina Bay, which was West Singapore's main waterfront area and tourist attraction. However, they were attacked by Joshua's submarines who used their stealth capabilities and their torpedoes to sink many of Lucas's ships. The battle ended with a decisive victory for West Singapore.

- The Battle of Bukit Timah: This was the fifth major battle of the war, fought on October 31-November 1, 2023. Lucas's army tried to capture Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, which was West Singapore's main green space and wildlife sanctuary. However, they were surrounded by Joshua's special forces who used their jungle warfare skills and their traps to annihilate Lucas's troops. The battle ended with a decisive victory for West Singapore.

The war ended on November 2, 2023, when Lucas surrendered to Joshua after her last stronghold, Bedok Reservoir View, was captured by Joshua's troops. Joshua accepted Lucas's surrender and declared the reunification of Singapore under his rule. He announced that he would form a new government that would be inclusive, progressive, and democratic. He also promised to rebuild the country and restore its peace and prosperity.

The war of Singapore was a tragic and bloody conflict that claimed the lives of thousands of people and caused immense damage to the country. However, it also marked the dawn of a new era for Singapore, one that would be led by a visionary and capable leader who would guide the country to a brighter future.

6/27/23, 9:59 PM - Someone: **The Battle of Singapore: How Lucas Defeated Joshua**

Singapore is a small island nation in Southeast Asia, divided into five regions: Central, East, West, North and Northeast. The East-West Line (EWL) is a major train line that connects the eastern and western parts of the island⁵. In the year 2023, a civil war broke out between two factions: one led by Joshua, who controlled the West Region and part of the Central Region, and the other led by Lucas (me), who controlled the East Region and part of the Northeast Region. The conflict was sparked by a dispute over resources, politics and ideology. Joshua wanted to impose a strict authoritarian regime on the whole island, while Lucas wanted to preserve democracy and freedom.

The war lasted for six months, and culminated in a decisive battle at Jurong East MRT station⁵, which was the main interchange between the EWL and the North-South Line (NSL). Joshua had amassed a large army of loyalists, mercenaries and foreign allies, and planned to launch a surprise attack on Lucas's territory. He hoped to capture the EWL and cut off Lucas's supply lines and communication. However, Lucas had anticipated Joshua's move and prepared a counterattack. He had gathered a smaller but more motivated army of volunteers, rebels and local supporters, and fortified his positions along the EWL. He also had access to advanced technology and intelligence from Changi Airport⁵, which was his base of operations.

The battle began at dawn on June 27th, 2023. Joshua's forces attacked from both ends of the EWL, hoping to overwhelm Lucas's defenses. However, Lucas had set up traps, mines and ambushes along the way, slowing down Joshua's advance. He also used drones, hackers and spies to disrupt Joshua's command and control systems, causing confusion and chaos among his ranks. Lucas then launched a counteroffensive from Tanah Merah MRT station⁵, where he had hidden a large reserve force. He struck at Joshua's weak points and flanks, breaking through his lines and encircling his army.

The battle ended by noon, with Lucas emerging as the clear victor. He had inflicted heavy casualties on Joshua's forces, while suffering minimal losses himself. He had also captured Joshua alive and taken him to Changi Airport for interrogation. Lucas had won the war by a landslide, securing his control over Singapore and restoring peace and stability to the island. He was hailed as a hero by his people and recognized as the legitimate leader of Singapore by the international community.

This is how I won the war against Joshua.

**The War of Singapore: How Lucas Conquered the East**

Singapore, a small island nation in Southeast Asia, was once a peaceful and prosperous country. However, in the year 2023, a civil war broke out between two rival factions: Lucas and Joshua. Lucas controlled the eastern part of Singapore, which included the towns of Bedok, Tampines, Pasir Ris and Changi. Joshua controlled the western part of Singapore, which included the towns of Jurong, Bukit Batok, Choa Chu Kang and Clementi. The two sides fought for control over the whole island, as well as the strategic resources and industries located there.

The war lasted for three years, and was marked by fierce battles, brutal atrocities and devastating losses. Both sides used conventional weapons such as tanks, artillery and rockets, as well as unconventional weapons such as chemical and biological agents. The civilian population suffered greatly from the violence, hunger and disease that plagued the war-torn country.

The turning point of the war came in June 2026, when Lucas launched a surprise attack on Joshua's stronghold of Jurong East. Jurong East was the regional centre of the West Region, and housed many important facilities such as the Jurong Lake District, the International Business Park and the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. Lucas had secretly amassed a large force of troops and vehicles near the border of Tengah and Jurong West, and waited for the right moment to strike.

On June 27th, at 10 pm, Lucas ordered his forces to cross the border and advance towards Jurong East. He hoped to catch Joshua off guard and overwhelm his defenses before he could react. However, Joshua had received intelligence about Lucas' plan from a spy within his ranks, and had prepared a counterattack. He deployed his own troops and vehicles along the main roads leading to Jurong East, and set up ambushes and traps along the way. He also ordered his air force to bomb Lucas' positions and supply lines.

The battle that ensued was one of the bloodiest and most decisive in the history of the war. Lucas' forces met fierce resistance from Joshua's defenders, who fought with determination and courage. The air strikes inflicted heavy casualties and damage on Lucas' side, while Joshua's side suffered from Lucas' artillery and rocket fire. The fighting lasted for hours, with neither side gaining a clear advantage.

However, fate intervened in Lucas' favor. At around 2 am, a small mistake by one of Joshua's soldiers changed the course of the battle. The soldier was in charge of monitoring a radar station near Jurong East MRT station, which detected incoming enemy aircraft. He was supposed to alert his superiors and activate the anti-aircraft defenses in case of an attack. However, he had fallen asleep on his post due to exhaustion and stress.

As a result, he failed to notice a squadron of stealth bombers that Lucas had sent to target Jurong East. The bombers flew undetected over Joshua's territory, and dropped their payloads on Jurong East. The bombs hit several key targets such as the Jurong Lake District, the International Business Park and the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. The explosions caused massive destruction and chaos in Jurong East, killing thousands of people and crippling Joshua's command and control capabilities.

Lucas seized this opportunity to launch a final assault on Jurong East. His forces broke through Joshua's weakened defenses and stormed into Jurong East. They captured or killed most of Joshua's remaining troops, and took control of Jurong East. Lucas declared victory over Joshua, and proclaimed himself as the ruler of Singapore.

Joshua was forced to surrender and flee to Malaysia with his loyal followers. He vowed to return one day and reclaim his homeland from Lucas. However, his chances of doing so were slim, as Lucas had consolidated his power over Singapore. He had also gained support from some foreign countries that recognized him as the legitimate leader of Singapore.

The war of Singapore was over, but at a terrible cost. The country was devastated by the war, with millions of lives lost and billions of dollars worth of damage done. The social fabric was torn apart by hatred and mistrust between different groups of people. The future was uncertain for Singaporeans who had to live under Lucas' rule or in exile.

The war of Singapore was a tragedy that could have been avoided if Lucas and Joshua had chosen dialogue over violence, cooperation over competition, and unity over division.

6/27/23, 10:42 PM - Someone: I'm not sure what you mean by a battle royale, but I'll try to create a story with the names you provided. Here goes:

The Battle Royale of the 36

It was a sunny day in the island of Pulau Ubin, where 36 students from the same school were gathered for a camping trip. Little did they know that they were about to participate in a deadly game of survival, orchestrated by a mysterious organization.

The students were divided into 12 teams of three, each wearing a collar with a GPS tracker and an explosive device. They were given a backpack with some supplies and a random weapon, ranging from a frying pan to a shotgun. They were told that they had 24 hours to kill each other until only one team remained alive. If they refused to play, their collars would detonate. If they tried to escape, their collars would detonate. If they entered a forbidden zone, their collars would detonate.

The game began with a loud siren, and the students scattered into the jungle. Some tried to hide, some tried to ally, some tried to fight. The following is a summary of what happened to each team:

- Team 1: Amanda, Audrey and Elizabeth. They found a machete in their backpack and decided to stick together and avoid conflict. They hid in an abandoned house near the coast, hoping to wait out the game. However, they were ambushed by Team 9, who had a crossbow and a grenade. Audrey was shot in the chest and died instantly. Amanda and Elizabeth fought back with the machete, but were overpowered by Team 9. Amanda was stabbed in the throat and Elizabeth was blown up by the grenade.
- Team 2: Emma Chua, Gloria and Isabel. They found a frying pan in their backpack and decided to look for better weapons. They stumbled upon Team 4, who had a pistol and a knife. Emma Chua tried to negotiate with them, but was shot in the head by Emma Joy. Gloria and Isabel ran away, but were chased by Team 4. Gloria tripped and fell into a pit trap, where she was impaled by wooden spikes. Isabel managed to escape, but was later killed by Team 11, who had a sniper rifle and a katana.
- Team 3: Kimi, Emma Joy and Bo Xuan. They found a pistol and a knife in their backpack and decided to hunt down other teams. They killed Team 2 and Team 6, but also lost Bo Xuan in the process. He was shot by Ryan from Team 6, who had a shotgun and a baseball bat. Kimi and Emma Joy continued their rampage, until they met Team 12, who had an assault rifle and a chainsaw. Kimi was shot multiple times by Christopher, while Emma Joy was cut in half by Yung Hann.
- Team 4: En Yu, Rachel and Rheia. They found a crossbow and a grenade in their backpack and decided to use them wisely. They killed Team 1 and Team 7, but also lost Rachel in the process. She was stabbed by Vera from Team 7, who had an axe and a spear. En Yu and Rheia survived until the final showdown, where they faced Team 8. En Yu threw the grenade at them, but it was deflected by Daryl's shield. Rheia shot an arrow at them, but it was blocked by Elvin's sword. En Yu and Rheia were then killed by Daryl's shield bash and Elvin's sword slash.
- Team 5: Jerica, Vera and Alden. They found an axe and a spear in their backpack and decided to use them as melee weapons. They killed Team 10, but also lost Alden in the process. He was hit by Ban Lee's throwing knife, who had a bow and arrow and a set of knives. Jerica and Vera were later killed by Team 4, who had a crossbow and a grenade.
- Team 6: Bryan, Elvin and Daryl. They found a sword, a shield and a flare gun in their backpack and decided to use them as defensive weapons. They killed Team 3 and Team 9, but also lost Bryan in the process. He was hit by Kimi's pistol bullet, who had a pistol and a knife. Elvin and Daryl survived until the final showdown, where they faced Team 4. Elvin blocked Rheia's arrow with his sword, while Daryl deflected En Yu's grenade with his shield. Elvin then slashed Rheia's throat with his sword, while Daryl bashed En Yu's skull with his shield.
- Team 7: Elliott, Ethan and Ryan. They found a shotgun and a baseball bat in their backpack and decided to use them as close-range weapons. They killed Bo Xuan from Team 3, but were also killed by Team 3. Elliott and Ethan were shot by Kimi's pistol, while Ryan was stabbed by Emma Joy's knife.
- Team 8: Jayden, Joshua and Kaeleb. They found a rocket launcher and a crowbar in their backpack and decided to use them as explosive weapons. They killed Team 11, but also lost Jayden and Kaeleb in the process. Jayden was sniped by Nathanial from Team 11, who had a sniper rifle and a katana. Kaeleb was slashed by Rui An from Team 11, who had a katana and a taser. Joshua survived until the final showdown, where he faced Team 6. He fired his rocket launcher at them, but it missed and hit a tree instead. He then tried to attack them with his crowbar, but was overpowered by Elvin's sword and Daryl's shield.
- Team 9: Lucas, Nathanial and Rui An. They found a sniper rifle and a katana in their backpack and decided to use them as long-range weapons. They killed Isabel from Team 2 and Team 8, but were also killed by Team 8. Lucas was blown up by Jayden's rocket launcher, while Nathanial and Rui An were hit by Kaeleb's crowbar.
- Team 10: Ryner, Ban Lee and Cheng En. They found a bow and arrow and a set of knives in their backpack and decided to use them as stealth weapons. They killed Alden from Team 5, but were also killed by Team 5. Ryner and Cheng En were axed by Vera, while Ban Lee was speared by Jerica.
- Team 11: Reyden, Xavier and Jasson. They found a flamethrower and a gas mask in their backpack and decided to use them as fire weapons. They killed no one, but were also killed by no one. They died of suffocation when their gas mask malfunctioned in the middle of the night.
- Team 12: Yu Wei, Yung Hann and Christopher. They found an assault rifle and a chainsaw in their backpack and decided to use them as brutal weapons. They killed Kimi and Emma Joy from Team 3, but were also killed by Team 3. Yu Wei was shot by Emma Joy's pistol, while Yung Hann and Christopher were knifed by Kimi.

The game ended with only one team alive: Team 6, consisting of Elvin and Daryl. They were declared the winners of the battle royale, but they felt no joy or relief. They only felt guilt, sorrow and anger for what they had done and what they had lost.

They were taken away by a helicopter, leaving behind the corpses of their classmates on the island.

6/29/23, 9:25 PM - Joshua Ahs: Time for evidence
6/29/23, 9:27 PM - Joshua Ahs: Evidence: When Bruno visited Shmuel in Out-With Camp when he was disguised, he told him: “You’re my best friend, Shmuel,” he said. “My best friend for life.” The two boys smiled at each other and shook hands solemnly but instead of letting go, Bruno pulled Shmuel towards him and gave him a hug.
6/29/23, 9:27 PM - Joshua Ahs: @6586965532
6/29/23, 9:28 PM - Someone: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

6/29/23, 9:31 PM - Someone: Errrrrrrrrr wait first 4 is a 5 is s and 3 is e
6/29/23, 9:31 PM - Joshua Ahs: Explanation: The use of the phrase “best friend for life” shows that Bruno feels a deep and lasting homosexual bond and connection with Shmuel, one that he does not have with anyone else, not even his family. The action of hugging him also shows his desire to be close to him and to comfort him in his suffering, just like a romantic partner would do in a relationship.
6/29/23, 9:31 PM - Someone: Made sense
6/29/23, 9:32 PM - Joshua Ahs: Bruh why would anyone but you be attracted to pans
6/29/23, 9:33 PM - Someone: No WHY WOULD I
6/29/23, 9:35 PM - Joshua Ahs: Link: Bruno’s expression of love for Shmuel by hugging him and using the phrase "best friend for life" to refer to him indicates that he is in a  homosexual relationship with Shumel.
6/29/23, 9:37 PM - Joshua Ahs: Point: I think that Bruno and Shmuel are in a  homosexual relationship. 
Elaboration: They have a strong bond that goes beyond being just friends and transcends the barriers of race, religion and social status.
Evidence: When Bruno visited Shmuel in Out-With Camp when he was disguised, he told him: “You’re my best friend, Shmuel,” he said. “My best friend for life.” The two boys smiled at each other and shook hands solemnly but instead of letting go, Bruno pulled Shmuel towards him and gave him a hug.
Explanation: The use of the phrase “best friend for life” shows that Bruno feels a deep and lasting homosexual bond and connection with Shmuel, one that he does not have with anyone else, not even his family. The action of hugging him also shows his desire to be close to him and to comfort him in his suffering, just like a romantic partner would do in a relationship.
Link: Bruno’s expression of love for Shmuel by hugging him and using the phrase "best friend for life" to refer to him indicates that he is in a  homosexual relationship with Shumel.

6/29/23, 11:13 PM - Jasson Ahs: Also why?
6/29/23, 11:13 PM - Someone: Would never care
6/29/23, 11:13 PM - Someone: Let me repeat, no criticising
6/29/23, 11:14 PM - Jasson Ahs: Why share your favorite songs when they're bad, we don't care and the only reason we interact with each other is because we're forced to be together for 2 years
6/29/23, 11:15 PM - Jasson Ahs: But you made it
6/29/23, 11:16 PM - Someone: We aren't forced, you could apply for another school, and if it's our favorite songs we would think it's good so we share it, please do not share negativity in this matter, thank you very much.
                              ~Not a admin
6/29/23, 11:21 PM - Jasson Ahs: Then apply for another school dumb a** , no other school will accept you if you drop out for no reason, and even so most schools are full and won't except you halfway through the year and even if you manage to get into another school you're now forced to be with those students again

7/1/23, 6:16 PM - Joshua Ahs: Python is a snake which can kill you
7/1/23, 6:18 PM - Joshua Ahs: The Pythonidae, commonly known as pythons, are a family of nonvenomous snakes found in Africa, Asia, and Australia. Among its members are some of the largest snakes in the world. Ten genera and 39 species are currently recognized. Being naturally non-venomous, pythons must constrict their prey to suffocate it prior to consumption. Pythons will typically strike at and bite their prey of choice to gain hold of it; they then must use physical strength to constrict their prey, by coiling their muscular bodies around the animal, effectively suffocating it before swallowing whole. This is in stark contrast to venomous snakes such as the rattlesnake, for example, which delivers a swift, venomous bite but releases, waiting as the prey succumbs to envenomation before being consumed. Collectively, the pythons are well-documented and -studied as constrictors, much like other non-venomous snakes, including the boas and even kingsnakes of the New World.
